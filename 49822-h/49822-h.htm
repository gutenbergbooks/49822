<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>
</div>


<p>More than one clue must be unravelled
to reach an understanding of Abraham
Lincoln. Among them there surely
must be reckoned his capacity for companionship.
None more catholic in his
selections ever lived. All men were his
fellows. He went unerringly and unconsciously
for the most part, to the meeting
place that awaited him in each man’s nature.
There might be a wall, often there
was; but he knew, no one better, that
there is always a secret door in human
walls. Sooner or later he discovered it,
put his finger on its spring, passed
through and settled into the place behind
that was his.</p>

<p>His life was rich in companionships<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[VIII]</a></span>
with unlikely people, often people who
began by contempt or semi-contempt of
him. There was the town bully of his
youth, whom he soundly thrashed for trying
a foul in a wrestling match, and who
rose from the dust to proclaim Lincoln
the best man who ever broke into camp;
thirty years later there was his own Secretary
of State, with his self-complacent
assumption of the President’s unfitness
for leadership and of his own call to direct
the nation, put gently but firmly in
his place and soon frankly and nobly declaring,
“He’s the best of us all.”</p>

<p>He had many pass-keys—wrath, magnanimity,
shrewdness, patience, clarity
of judgment, humor, resolve; and in the
end, one or the other or all together
opened every closed door, and he sat
down at home with men of the most divergent
view and experience: the bully,
the scholarly, the cunning, the pious, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[IX]</a></span>
ambitious, the selfish, the great, the weak,
the boy, the man.</p>

<p>Particularly was Lincoln at home with
men like the Billy Brown of these pages,
men whose native grain had not been
obscured by polish and oil. There were
many of them in his time in Illinois, plying
their trades or professions more or less
busily, but never allowing industry to interfere
with opportunities for companionship.
They were men of shrewdness,
humor, usually modest, not over-weighted
with ambition. Their appetite for talk,
for politics, for reports on human exhibits
of all sorts, never dulled. Their love
of companionship outstripped even their
naturally intolerant partisanship.</p>

<p>These men, unconsciously for the most
part, resisted the social veneering that,
beginning in Illinois in Lincoln’s day,
rapidly overlaid the state. In his first
contact with Springfield in the ’30’s he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[X]</a></span>
remarked the “flourishing about in carriages,”
the separation of people into
groups according to money, antecedents,
social etiquette. He never allowed convention,
address, ceremony, however foreign
to him, to interfere with his human
relations—he went over or around them.
But, natural man that he was, he found
a special freedom with those in whom the
essence of human nature remained unmixed
and uncorked.</p>

<p>The original of Billy Brown was such
a man. He was still keeping his drug
store in Springfield in the ’90’s when the
writer made studies there for a “Life of
Lincoln.” She passed many an hour in
Lincoln’s chair, while Billy, tipped back
in something less precious, talked. There
were Billy Browns in other towns—Bloomington,
Princeton, Quincy, Chicago.
Their memory of Mr. Lincoln was
among the most precious and satisfying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[XI]</a></span>
things in their lives. When business was
dull or the day rainy and consequently
there were few or no interruptions, the
talk you started by questions soon became
a soliloquy. Head against the wall,
feet on desk, eyes far away, voice softened,
they re-lived the old friendship.
Their memories were tender, reverent
but singularly devoid of the thing that
we call hero-worship. Mr. Lincoln remained
too real to them, too interesting
and companionable.</p>

<p>The sense of intimacy with him which
they treasured, their conviction that he
recognized them as his friends, had little
or no trace of familiarity. He was always
“Mr. Lincoln” to them, never “Abe,” nor
would they tolerate the use of that word.
I never saw my Springfield Billy Brown
so angrily indignant as in talking of a
townsman who affected the name. True,
he and Billy were rivals in reminiscence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[XII]</a></span>
but that was not the basis of his resentment.
“He never called Mr. Lincoln that
to his face” was Billy’s complaint. That
is, the use of the name gave a false color
to the recollections and only truth was
tolerable where Mr. Lincoln was concerned.</p>

<p>If Mr. Lincoln’s fellowship with the
Billy Browns of Illinois was based on his
love of sheer human nature, he found in
them, too, something very precious to
him, and that was a humor that answered
his own. The spring from which his humor
flowed was strong with native salts
and so was theirs. It was naked but clean,
devoid of evil insinuation. It was always
out-with-it—strong, pungent words;
strong, pungent facts. The humor was
not in words or facts, it was in what they
pointed—the illumination they gave of
life and men. Lincoln’s humor was part
of his passion for reality, truthfulness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[XIII]</a></span>
freedom. The Billy Browns answered
him and gave him more of a particular
kind of salt he craved, in a life in many
ways starved, starved for love and hope
and gaiety, for all of which he had great
natural capacity.</p>

<p>The youthfulness of their spirit endeared
them to him. They were usually
some fifteen or twenty years his junior;
but in feeling the difference was greater.
Lincoln early looked on himself and
spoke of himself as an old man. It was
not years—it was burdens, defeats, the
failure to find a satisfying purpose in
life. He was old, and he craved youth.
These men had it. They were perennial
children. Youth seemed to warm him, and
he sought it wherever it was to be found—in
children, boys, young men. They in
turn instinctively came to him. A succession
of youth in all its forms follows him
through his goings and comings in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[XIV]</a></span>
streets of Springfield, along the route
of the old Eighth Circuit of Illinois,
through the streets of Washington, into
the White House.</p>

<p>His own children stirred the deepest
passion his unsatisfied heart ever knew.
Tad, whose stuttering tongue and restless,
valiant spirit brought out all Mr.
Lincoln’s tenderness, sat beside him
every free evening, going over the pictures
and text of the shoals of books
which publishers send to a President; he
helping the boy’s stumbling tongue to
frame his comments—a perfection of fellowship
between them. When the nights
were not free—and that was often, for
there were long conferences running into
the small hours, the lad slept beside him
on the floor of the conference room. And
when it was over, he gathered him up
in his arms and himself put him to bed,
consoled in the harrowing muddle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[XV]</a></span>
of affairs by the perfect love between
them.</p>

<p>One can never be too thankful that he
had John Hay, then a youth in his early
twenties—and such a youth! The joy and
fun and understanding between them as
it crops out in Hay’s letters is a streak of
pure sunshine across the almost soddenly
tragic life of the White House in the
Civil War.</p>

<p>This capacity for companionship
which so linked men of all types to Lincoln
in his lifetime and so held them to
him in death is one clue to his final success
in bringing out of the struggle over
slavery in this country certain solid and
definite results—results that have enlarged
the boundaries of human freedom
and given a convincing demonstration
of the need and the preciousness
of more and more unionism if we are to
secure our final better world. He could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[XVI]</a></span>
not have done what he did had he been
less understanding of men and their limitations
as well as of their powers, less
experienced in passing behind human
walls, finding what there was there and
using it, not asking of a man what he
could not give, not forcing on him what
he could not receive.</p>

<p>Who can estimate what it was to the
nation to have as a leader through the
Civil War a man “born with a pass-key
to hearts.”</p>

<p class="p2 cap">“Did I know Lincoln? Well,
I should say. See that
chair there? Take it, set
down. That’s right. Comfortable,
ain’t it? Well, sir, Abraham Lincoln
has set in that chair hours, him and
Little ‘Doug,’ and Logan and Judge
Davis, all of ’em, all the big men in this
State, set in that chair. See them marks?
Whittlin’. Judge Logan did it, all-firedest
man to whittle. Always cuttin’ away at
something. I just got that chair new, paid
six dollars for it, and I be blamed if I
didn’t come in this store and find him
slashin’ right into that arm. I picked up
a stick and said: ‘Here, Judge, s’posin’
you cut this.’ He just looked at me and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
then flounced out, mad as a wet hen.
Mr. Lincoln was here, and you ought to
heard him tee-hee. He was always here.
<a href="#image01">Come and set by the stove by the hour
and tell stories and talk and argue.</a> I’d
ruther heard the debates them men had
around this old stove than heard Webster
and Clay and Calhoun and the whole
United States Senate. There wa’n’t never
a United States Senate that could beat
just what I’ve heard right here in this
room with Lincoln settin’ in that very
chair where you are this minute.</p>

<p>“He traded here. I’ve got his accounts
now. See here, ‘quinine, quinine, quinine.’
Greatest hand to buy quinine you ever
see. Give it to his constituents. Oh, he
knew how to be popular, Mr. Lincoln did.
Cutest man in politics. I wa’n’t a Whig.
I was then and I am now a Democrat, a
real old-fashioned Jackson Democrat, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
my blood just would rise up sometimes
hearin’ him discuss. He was a dangerous
man—a durned dangerous man to have
agin you. He’d make you think a thing
when you knew it wa’n’t so, and cute!
Why, he’d just slide in when you wa’n’t
expectin’ it and do some unexpected
thing that u’d make you laugh, and
then he’d get your vote. You’d vote for
him because you liked him—just because
you liked him and because he was
so all-fired smart, and do it when you
knew he was wrong and it was agin the
interest of the country.</p>

<p>“Tell stories? Nobody ever could beat
him at that, and how he’d enjoy ’em, just
slap his hands on his knees and jump up
and turn around and then set down,
laughin’ to kill. Greatest man to git new
yarns that ever lived, always askin’,
‘Heard any new stories, Billy?’ And if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
I had I’d trot ’em out, and how he’d
laugh. Often and often when I’ve told
him something new and he’d kin’ a forgit
how it went, he’d come in and say, ‘Billy,
how about that story you’se tellin’ me?’
and then I’d tell it all over.</p>

<p>“He was away a lot, you know, ridin’
the circuit along with some right smart
lawyers. They had great doin’s. Nuthin’
to do evenings but to set around the
tavern stove tellin’ stories. That was
enough when Lincoln was there. They
was all lost without him. Old Judge Davis
was boss of that lot, and he never would
settle down till Lincoln got around. I’ve
heard ’em laugh lots of times how the
Judge would fuss around and keep askin’,
‘Where’s Mr. Lincoln, why don’t Mr.
Lincoln come? Somebody go and find
Lincoln,’ and when Lincoln came he
would just settle back and get him started<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
to yarning, and there they’d set half the
night.</p>

<p>“When he got home he’d come right in
here first time he was downtown and tell
me every blamed yarn he’d heard. Whole
crowd would get in here sometimes and
talk over the trip, and I tell you it was
something to hear ’em laugh. You could
tell how Lincoln kept things stirred up.
He was so blamed quick. Ever hear Judge
Weldon tell that story about what Lincoln
said one day up to Bloomington
when they was takin’ up a subscription
to buy Jim Wheeler a new pair of pants?
No? Well, perhaps I oughten to tell it to
you, ma says it ain’t nice. It makes me
mad to hear people objectin’ to Mr.
Lincoln’s stories. Mebbe he did say
words you wouldn’t expect to hear at a
church supper, but he never put no meanin’
into ’em that wouldn’t ’a’ been fit for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
the minister to put into a sermon, and
that’s a blamed sight more’n you can say
of a lot of stories I’ve heard some of the
people tell who stick up their noses at
Mr. Lincoln’s yarns.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, he used to keep things purty
well stirred up on that circuit. That time
I was a speakin’ of he made Judge Davis
real mad; it happened right in court and
everybody got to gigglin’ fit to kill. The
Judge knew ’twas something Lincoln
had said and he began to sputter.</p>

<p>“‘I am not going to stand this any
longer, Mr. Lincoln, you’re always disturbin’
this court with your tomfoolery.
I’m goin’ to fine you. The clerk will fine
Mr. Lincoln five dollars for disorderly
conduct.’ The boys said Lincoln never
said a word; he just set lookin’ down with
his hand over his mouth, tryin’ not to
laugh. About a minute later the Judge,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
who was always on pins and needles till
he knew all the fun that was goin’ on,
called up Weldon and whispered to him,
‘What was that Lincoln said?’ Weldon
told him, and I’ll be blamed if the Judge
didn’t giggle right out loud there in court.
The joke was on him then, and he knew
it, and soon as he got his face straight he
said, dignified like, ‘The clerk may remit
Mr. Lincoln’s fine.’</p>

<p>“Yes, he was a mighty cute story-teller,
but he knew what he was about tellin’
’em. I tell you he got more arguments out
of stories than he did out of law books,
and the queer part was you couldn’t
answer ’em—they just made you see it
and you couldn’t get around it. I’m a
Democrat, but I’ll be blamed if I didn’t
have to vote for Mr. Lincoln as President,
couldn’t help it, and it was all on account
of that snake story of his’n illustratin’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
the takin’ of slavery into Kansas and Nebraska.
Remember it? I heard him tell
it in a speech once.</p>

<p>“‘If I saw a pizen snake crawlin’ in
the road,’ he says, ‘I’d kill it with the
first thing I could grab; but if I found it
in bed with my children, I’d be mighty
careful how I touched it fear I’d make it
bite the children. If I found it in bed with
somebody else’s children I’d let them
take care of it; but if I found somebody
puttin’ a whole batch of young snakes
into an empty bed where mine or anybody’s
children was going to sleep pretty
soon, I’d stop him from doin’ it if I had
to fight him.’ Perhaps he didn’t say ‘fight
him,’ but somehow I always tell that
story that way because I know I would
and so would he or you or anybody. That
was what it was all about when you come
down to it. They was tryin’ to put a batch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
of snakes into an empty bed that folks
was goin’ to sleep in.</p>

<p>“Before I heard that story I’d heard
Lincoln say a hundred times, settin’ right
there in that chair, where you are, ‘Boys,
we’ve got to stop slavery or it’s goin’ to
spread all over this country,’ but, somehow,
I didn’t see it before. Them snakes
finished me. Then I knew he’d got it right
and I’d got to vote for him. Pretty tough,
though, for me to go back on Little
‘Doug.’ You see he was our great man,
so we thought. Been to the United States
Senate and knew all the big bugs all over
the country. Sort o’ looked and talked
great. Wan’t no comparison between him
and Lincoln in looks and talk. Of course,
we all knew he wa’n’t honest, like Lincoln,
but blamed if I didn’t think in them days
Lincoln was too all-fired honest—kind
of innocent honest. He couldn’t stand it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
nohow to have things said that wan’t so.
He just felt plumb bad about lies. I remember
once bein’ in court over to Decatur
when Mr. Lincoln was tryin’ a case.
There was a fellow agin him that didn’t
have no prejudices against lyin’ in a lawsuit,
and he was tellin’ how Lincoln had
said this an’ that, tryin’ to mix up the
jury. It was snowin’ bad outside, and Mr.
Lincoln had wet his feet and he was tryin’
to dry ’em at the stove. He had pulled off
one shoe and was settin’ there holdin’ up
his great big foot, his forehead all puckered
up, listenin’ to that ornery lawyer’s
lies. All at onct he jumped up and hopped
right out into the middle of the court-room.</p>

<p>“‘Now, Judge,’ he says, ‘that ain’t
fair. I didn’t say no sich thing, and he
knows I didn’t. I ain’t goin’ to have this
jury all fuddled up.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>“You never see anything so funny in a
court-room as that big fellow standin’
there in one stockin’ foot, a shoe in his
hand, talking so earnest. No, sir, he
couldn’t stand a lie.</p>

<p>“‘Think he was a big man, then?’
Nope—never did. Just as I said, we all
thought Douglas was <em>our</em> big man. You
know I felt kind of sorry for Lincoln
when they began to talk about him for
President. It seemed almost as if somebody
was makin’ fun of him. He didn’t
look like a president. I never had seen
one, but we had pictures of ’em, all of
’em from George Washington down, and
they looked somehow as if they were different
kind of timber from us. Leastwise
that’s always the way it struck me. Now
Mr. Lincoln he was just like your own
folks—no trouble to talk to him, no
siree. Somehow you just settled down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
comfortable to visitin’ the minute he come
in. I couldn’t imagine George Washington
or Thomas Jefferson settin’ here in
that chair you’re in tee-heein’ over some
blamed yarn of mine. None of us around
town took much stock in his bein’ elected
at first—that is, none of the men, the
women was different. They always believed
in him, and used to say, ‘You mark
my word, Mr. Lincoln will be president.
He’s just made for it, he’s good, he’s the
best man ever lived and he ought to be
president.’ I didn’t see no logic in that
then, but I dunno but there was some
after all.</p>

<p>“It seems all right now though. I reckon
I learned somethin’ watchin’ him be
President—learned a lot—not that it
made any difference in <em>him</em>. Funniest
thing to see him goin’ around in this
town—not a mite changed—and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
whole United States a watchin’ him and
the biggest men in the country runnin’
after him and reporters hangin’ around
to talk to him and fellers makin’ his pictures
in ile and every other way. That
didn’t make no difference to him—only
he didn’t like bein’ so busy he couldn’t
come in here much. He had a room over
there in the Court House—room on that
corner there. I never looked up that it
wa’n’t chuck full of people wantin’ him.
This old town was full of people all the
time—delegations and committees and
politicians and newspaper men. Only
time I ever see <a href="#image02">Horace Greeley, he came
in here to buy quinine</a>. Mr. Lincoln sent
him. Think of that, Horace Greeley buyin’
quinine of <em>me</em>.</p>

<div class="caption">
  <a href="#Page_15">“<i>Horace Greeley, he came in here to buy quinine</i>”</a>
</div></div>

<p>“No end of other great men around.
He saw ’em all. Sometimes I used to step
over and watch him—didn’t bother him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
a mite to see a big man—not a mite.
He’d jest shake hands and talk as easy
and natural as if ’twas me—and he
didn’t do no struttin’ either. Some of the
fellers who come to see him looked as if
<em>they</em> was goin’ to be president, but Mr.
Lincoln didn’t put on any airs. No, sir,
and he didn’t cut any of his old friends
either. Tickled to death to see ’em every
time, and they all come—blamed if
every old man and woman in Sangamon
County didn’t trot up here to see him.
They’d all knowed him when he was
keepin’ store down to New Salem and
swingin’ a chain—surveyed lots of their
towns for ’em—he had—and then he’d
electioneered all over that county, too,
so they just come in droves to bid him
good-by. I was over there one day when
old Aunt Sally Lowdy came in the door.
Aunt Sally lived down near New Salem,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
and I expect she’d mended Mr. Lincoln’s
pants many a time; for all them old women
down there just doted on him and
took care of him as if he was their own
boy. Well, Aunt Sally stood lookin’ kind
a scared seein’ so many strangers and not
knowin’ precisely what to do, when Mr.
Lincoln spied her. Quick as a wink he
said, ‘Excuse me, gentlemen,’ and he
just rushed over to that old woman and
shook hands with both of his’n and says,
‘Now, Aunt Sally, this is real kind of you
to come and see me. How are you and
how’s Jake?’ (Jake was her boy.) ‘Come
right over here,’ and he led her over, as if
she was the biggest lady in Illinois, and
says, ‘Gentlemen, this is a good old friend
of mine. She can make the best flapjacks
you ever tasted, and she’s baked ’em for
me many a time.’ Aunt Sally was jest as
pink as a rosy, she was so tickled. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
she says, ‘Abe’—all the old folks in
Sangamon called him Abe. They knowed
him as a boy, but don’t you believe anybody
ever did up here. No, sir, we said
Mr. Lincoln. He was like one of us, but
he wa’n’t no man to be over familiar with.
‘Abe,’ says Aunt Sally, ‘I had to come
and say good-by. They say down our way
they’re goin’ to kill you if they get you
down to Washington, but I don’t believe
it. I just tell ’em you’re too smart to let
’em git ahead of you that way. I thought
I’d come and bring you a present, knit
’em myself,’ and I’ll be blamed if that old
lady didn’t pull out a great big pair of
yarn socks and hand ’em to Mr. Lincoln.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, it was the funniest thing to
see Mr. Lincoln’s face pucker up and his
eyes twinkle and twinkle. He took them
socks and held ’em up by the toes, one in
each hand. They was the longest socks I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
ever see. ‘The lady got my latitude and
longitude ’bout right, didn’t she, gentlemen?’
he says, and then he laid ’em
down and he took Aunt Sally’s hand and
he says tender-like, ‘<a href="#image03">Aunt Sally, you
couldn’t a done nothin’ which would
have pleased me better.</a> I’ll take ’em to
Washington and wear ’em, and think
of you when I do it.’ And I declare he
said it so first thing I knew I was almost
blubberin’, and I wan’t the only
one nuther, and I bet he did wear ’em in
Washington. I can jest see him pullin’
off his shoe and showin’ them socks to
Sumner or Seward or some other big bug
that was botherin’ him when he wanted
to switch off on another subject and tellin’
’em the story about Aunt Sally and her
flapjacks.</p>

<p>“‘Was there much talk about his bein’
killed?’ Well, there’s an awful lot of fools<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
in this world and when they don’t git what
they want they’re always for killin’ somebody.
Mr. Lincoln never let on, but I
reckon his mail was pretty lively readin’
sometimes. He got pictures of gallows
and pistols and other things and lots of
threats, so they said. I don’t think that
worried him much. He was more bothered
seein’ old Buchanan givin’ the game
away. ‘I wish I could have got down
there before the horse was stole,’ I heard
him say onct in here, talkin’ to some men.
‘But I reckon I can find the tracks when
I do git there.’ It was his cabinet bothered
him most, I always thought. He didn’t
know the men he’d got to take well
enough. Didn’t know how far he could
count on ’em. He and Judge Gillespie
and one or two others was in here one
day sittin’ by the stove talkin,’ and he
says, ‘Judge, I wisht I could take all you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
boys down to Washington with me,
Democrats and all, and make a cabinet
out of you. I’d know where every man
would fit and we could git right down to
work. Now, I’ve got to learn my men
before I can do much.’ ‘Do you mean,
Mr. Lincoln, you’d take a Democrat like
Logan?’ says the Judge, sort of shocked.
‘Yes, sir, I would; I know Logan. He’s
agin me now and that’s all right, but if
we have trouble you can count on Logan
to do the right thing by the country,
and that’s the kind of men I want—them
as will do the right thing by the country.
Tain’t a question of Lincoln, or Democrat
or Republican, Judge; it’s a question
of the country.’</p>

<p>“Of course he seemed pretty cheerful
always. He wan’t no man to show out all
he felt. Lots of them little stuck-up chaps
that came out here to talk to him said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
solemn as owls, ‘He don’t realize the
gravity of the situation.’ Them’s their
words, ‘gravity of the situation.’ Think of
that, Mr. Lincoln not realizing. They
ought to heard him talk to us the night he
went away. I’ll never forgit that speech—nor
any man who heard it. I can see him
now just how he looked, standin’ there on
the end of his car. He’d been shakin’
hands with the crowd in the depot, laughin’
and talkin’, just like himself, but when
he got onto that car he seemed suddint
to be all changed. You never seen a face
so sad in all the world. I tell you he had
woe in his heart that minute, woe. He
knew he was leavin’ us for good, nuthin’
else could explain the way he looked and
what he said. He knew he never was
comin’ back alive. It was rainin’ hard,
but when we saw him standin’ there
bare headed, his great big eyes lookin’ at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
us so lovin’ and mournful, every man of
us took off his hat, just as if he’d been in
church. You never heard him make a
speech, of course? You missed a lot.
Curious voice. You could hear it away
off—kind of shrill, but went right to
your heart—and that night it sounded
sadder than anything I ever heard. You
know I always hear it to this day, nights
when the wind howls around the house.
Ma says it makes her nervous to hear me
talk about him such nights, but I can’t
help it; just have to let out.</p>

<p>“He stood a minute lookin’ at us, and
then he began to talk. There ain’t a man
in this town that heard him that ever forgot
what he said, but I don’t believe
there’s a man that ever said it over out
loud—he couldn’t, without cryin’. <a href="#image04">He
just talked to us that time out of his heart.</a>
Somehow we felt all of a suddint how we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
loved him and how he loved us. We
hadn’t taken any stock in all that talk
about his bein’ killed, but when he said
he was goin’ away not knowin’ where or
whether ever he would return I just got
cold all over. I begun to <em>see</em> that minute
and everybody did. The women all fell to
sobbin’ and a kind of groan went up, and
when he asked us to pray for him I don’t
believe that there was a man in that
crowd, whether he ever went to church
in his life, that didn’t want to drop right
down on his marrow bones and ask the
Lord to take care of Abraham Lincoln
and bring him back to us, where he belonged.</p>

<p>“‘Ever see him again?’ Yes, onct
down in Washington, summer of ’64.
Things was lookin’ purty blue that summer.
Didn’t seem to be anybody who
thought he’d git reëlected. Greeley was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
abusin’ him in <cite>The Tribune</cite> for not makin’
peace, and you know there was about
half the North that always let Greeley
do their thinkin’ fer ’em. The war wan’t
comin’ on at all—seemed as if they never
would do nuthin’. Grant was hangin’ on
to Petersburg like a dog to a root, but it
didn’t seem to do no good. Same with
Sherman, who was tryin’ to take Atlanta.
The country was just petered out with
the everlastin’ taxes an’ fightin’ an’ dyin’.
It wa’n’t human nature to be patient any
longer, and they just spit it out on Mr.
Lincoln, and then, right on top of all the
grumblin’ and abusin’, he up and made
another draft. Course he was right, but I
tell you nobody but a brave man would
’a’ done such a thing at that minute; but
he did it. It was hard on us out here. I
tell you there wa’n’t many houses in this
country where there wa’n’t mournin’ goin’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
on. It didn’t seem as if we <em>could</em> stand any
more blood lettin.’ Some of the boys
round the State went down to see him
about it. They came back lookin’ pretty
sheepish. Joe Medill, up to Chicago, told
me about it onct. He said, ‘We just told
Mr. Lincoln we couldn’t stand another
draft. We was through sendin’ men down
to Petersburg to be killed in trenches. He
didn’t say nuthin’; just stood still, lookin’
down till we’d all talked ourselves out;
and then, after a while, he lifted up his
head, and looked around at us, slow-like;
and I tell you, Billy, I never knew till
that minute that Abraham Lincoln could
get mad clean through. He was just white
he was that mad. “Boys,” he says, “you
ought to be ashamed of yourselves. <a href="#image05">You’re
actin’ like a lot of cowards. You’ve helped
make this war, and you’ve got to help
fight it.</a> You go home and raise them men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
and don’t you dare come down here again
blubberin’ about what I tell you to do. I
won’t stan’ it.” We was so scared we
never said a word. We just took our hats
and went out like a lot of school-boys.
Talk about Abraham Lincoln bein’ easy!
When it didn’t matter mebbe he was
easy, but when it did you couldn’t stir
him any more’n you could a mountain.’</p>

</div>

<p>“Well, I kept hearin’ about the trouble
he was havin’ with everybody, and I just
made up my mind I’d go down and see
him and swap yarns and tell him how we
was all countin’ on his gettin’ home.
Thought maybe it would cheer him up to
know we set such store on his comin’
home if they didn’t want him for president.
So I jest picked up and went right
off. Ma was real good about my goin’.
She says, ‘I shouldn’t wonder if ’twould
do him good, William. And don’t you ask<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
him no questions about the war nor
about politics. You just talk home to him
and tell him some of them foolish stories
of yourn.’</p>

<p>“Well, I had a brother in Washington,
clerk in a department—awful set up
’cause he had an office—and when I got
down there I told him I’d come to visit
Mr. Lincoln. He says, ‘William, be you a
fool? Folks don’t visit the President of
the United States without an invitation,
and he’s too busy to see anybody but the
very biggest people in this administration.
Why, he don’t even see me,’ he says.
Well, it made me huffy to hear him talk.
‘Isaac,’ I says, ‘I don’t wonder Mr. Lincoln
don’t see you. But it’s different with
me. Him and me is friends.’</p>

<p>“‘Well’ he says, ‘you’ve got to have
cards anyway.’ ‘Cards,’ I says, ‘what
for? What kind?’ ‘Why,’ he says, ‘visitin’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
cards—with your name on.’ ‘Well,’
I says, ‘it’s come to a pretty pass, if an
old friend like me can’t see Mr. Lincoln
without sendin’ him a piece of pasteboard.
I’d be ashamed to do such a thing,
Isaac Brown. Do you suppose he’s forgotten
me? Needs to see my name printed
out to know who I am? You can’t make
me believe any such thing,’ and I walked
right out of the room, and that night I
footed it up to the Soldiers’ Home where
Mr. Lincoln was livin’ then, right among
the sick soldiers in their tents.</p>

<p>“There was lots of people settin’
around in a little room, waitin’ fer him,
but there wan’t anybody there I knowed,
and I was feelin’ a little funny when a
door opened and out came little John
Nicolay. He came from down this way,
so I just went up and says, ‘How’d you
do, John; where’s Mr. Lincoln?’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Well, John didn’t seem over glad to see
me.</p>

<p>“‘Have you an appintment with Mr.
Lincoln?’ he says.</p>

<p>“‘No, sir,’ I says; ‘I ain’t, and it ain’t
necessary. Mebbe it’s all right and fittin’
for them as wants post-offices to have
appintments, but I reckon Mr. Lincoln’s
old friends don’t need ’em, so you just
trot along, Johnnie, and tell him Billy
Brown’s here and see what he says.’ Well,
he kind a flushed up and set his lips together,
but he knowed me, and so he went
off. In about two minutes the door popped
open and out came Mr. Lincoln, his face
all lit up. He saw me first thing, and he
laid holt of me and just shook my hands
fit to kill. ‘Billy,’ he says, ‘now I am
glad to see you. Come right in. You’re
goin’ to stay to supper with Mary and
me.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>“Didn’t I know it? Think bein’ president
would change him—not a mite.
Well, he had a right smart lot of people
to see, but soon as he was through <a href="#image06">we
went out on the back stoop and set down
and talked and talked</a>. He asked me
about pretty nigh everybody in Springfield.
I just let loose and told him about
the weddin’s and births and the funerals
and the buildin’, and I guess there wan’t
a yarn I’d heard in the three years and a
half he’d been away that I didn’t spin for
him. Laugh—you ought to a heard him
laugh—just did my heart good, for I
could see what they’d been doin’ to him.
Always was a thin man, but, Lordy, he
was thinner’n ever now, and his face was
kind a drawn and gray—enough to make
you cry.</p>

downtown. Wanted me to stay all
night, but I says to myself, ‘Billy, don’t
you overdo it. You’ve cheered him up,
and you better light out and let him remember
it when he’s tired.’ So I said,
‘Nope, Mr. Lincoln, can’t, goin’ back to
Springfield to-morrow. Ma don’t like to
have me away and my boy ain’t no great
shakes keepin’ store.’ ‘Billy,’ he says,
‘what did you come down here for?’ ‘I
come to see you, Mr. Lincoln.’ ‘But you
ain’t asked me for anything, Billy. What
is it? Out with it. Want a post-office?’
he said, gigglin’, for he knowed I didn’t.
‘No, Mr. Lincoln, just wanted to see <em>you</em>—felt
kind a lonesome—been so long
since I’d seen you, and I was afraid I’d
forgit some of them yarns if I didn’t unload
soon.’</p>

<p>“Well, sir, you ought to seen his face as
he looked at me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘Billy Brown,’ he says, slow-like, ‘do
you mean to tell me you came all the way
from Springfield, Illinois, just to have a
<em>visit</em> with <em>me</em>, that you don’t want an
office for anybody, nor a pardon for anybody,
that you ain’t got no complaints in
your pocket, nor any advice up your
sleeve?’</p>

<p>“‘Yes, sir,’ I says, ‘that’s about it, and
I’ll be durned if I wouldn’t go to <em>Europe</em>
to see you, if I couldn’t do it no other way,
Mr. Lincoln.’</p>

<p>“Well, sir, I never was so astonished
in my life. He just grabbed my hand and
shook it nearly off, and the tears just
poured down his face, and he says, ‘Billy,
you never’ll know what good you’ve done
me. I’m homesick, Billy, just plumb
homesick, and it seems as if this war
never would be over. Many a night I can
see the boys a-dyin’ on the fields and can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
hear their mothers cryin’ for ’em at home,
and I can’t help ’em, Billy. I have to send
them down there. We’ve got to save the
Union, Billy, we’ve got to.’</p>

<p>“‘Course we have, Mr. Lincoln,’ I
says, cheerful as I could, ‘course we have.
Don’t you worry. It’s most over. You’re
goin’ to be reëlected, and you and old
Grant’s goin’ to finish this war mighty
quick then. Just keep a stiff upper lip,
Mr. Lincoln, and don’t forget them yarns
I told you.’ And I started out. But seems
as if he couldn’t let me go. ‘Wait a minute,
Billy,’ he says, ‘till I get my hat and
I’ll walk a piece with you.’ It was one of
them still sweet-smellin’ summer nights
with no end of stars and you ain’t no idee
how pretty ’twas walkin’ down the road.
There was white tents showin’ through
the trees and every little way a tall soldier
standin’ stock still, a gun at his side.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Made me feel mighty curious and solemn.
By-and-by we come out of the trees to a
sightly place where you could look all
over Washington—see the Potomac and
clean into Virginia. There was a bench
there and we set down and after a while
Mr. Lincoln he begun to talk. Well, sir,
you or nobody ever heard anything like
it. Blamed if he didn’t tell me the whole
thing—all about the war and the generals
and Seward and Sumner and Congress
and Greeley and the whole blamed
lot. He just opened up his heart if I do
say it. Seemed as if he’d come to a p’int
where he must let out. I dunno how long
we set there—must have been nigh
morning, fer the stars begun to go out
before he got up to go. ‘Good-by, Billy,’
he says, ‘you’re the first person I ever
unloaded onto, and I hope you won’t
think I’m a baby,’ and then we shook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
hands again, and I walked down to town
and next day I come home.</p>

<p>“Tell you what he said? Nope, I can’t.
Can’t talk about it somehow. Fact is, I
never told anybody about what he said
that night. Tried to tell ma onct, but she
cried, so I give it up.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s the last time I seen him—last
time alive.</p>

<p>“Wa’n’t long after that things began to
look better. War began to move right
smart, and, soon as it did, there wa’n’t no
use talkin’ about anybody else for President.
I see that plain enough, and, just as
I told him, he was reëlected, and him an’
Grant finished up the war in a hurry. I
tell you it was a great day out here when
we heard Lee had surrendered. ’Twas
just like gettin’ converted to have the war
over. Somehow the only thing I could
think of was how glad Mr. Lincoln would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
be. Me and ma reckoned he’d come
right out and make us a visit and get
rested, and we began right off to make
plans about the reception we’d give
him—brass band—parade—speeches—fireworks—everything.
Seems as if I
couldn’t think about anything else. I was
comin’ down to open the store one mornin’,
and all the way down I was plannin’
how I’d decorate the windows and how
I’d tie a flag on that old chair, when I see
Hiram Jones comin’ toward me. He
looked so old and all bent over I didn’t
know what had happened. ‘Hiram,’ I
says, ‘what’s the matter? Be you
sick?’</p>

<p>“‘Billy,’ he says, and he couldn’t hardly
say it, ‘Billy, they’ve killed Mr. Lincoln.’</p>

<p>“Well, I just turned cold all over, and
then I flared up. ‘Hiram Jones,’ I says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
‘you’re lyin,’ you’re crazy. How dare you
tell me that? It ain’t so.’</p>

<p>“‘Don’t Billy,’ he says, ‘don’t go on so.
I ain’t lyin’. It’s so. He’ll never come
back, Billy. He’s dead!’ And he fell to
sobbin’ out loud right there in the street,
and somehow I knew it was true.</p>

<p>“I come on down and opened the door.
People must have paregoric and castor
ile and liniment, no matter who dies; but
I didn’t put up the shades. I just sat here
and thought and thought and groaned
and groaned. It seemed that day as if the
country was plumb ruined and I didn’t
care much. All I could think of was <em>him</em>.
He wan’t goin’ to come back. He wouldn’t
never sit here in that chair again. He was
dead.</p>

<p>“For days and days ’twas awful here.
Waitin’ and waitin’. Seemed as if that
funeral never would end. I couldn’t bear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
to think of him bein’ dragged around the
country and havin’ all that fuss made over
him. He always hated fussin’ so. Still, I
s’pose I’d been mad if they hadn’t done it.
Seemed awful, though. I kind a felt that
he belonged to us now, that they ought to
bring him back and let us have him now
they’d killed him.</p>

<p>“Of course they got here at last, and I
must say it was pretty grand. All sorts
of big bugs, Senators and Congressmen,
and officers in grand uniforms and
music and flags and crape. They certainly
didn’t spare no pains givin’ him a funeral.
Only we didn’t want ’em. We wanted to
bury him ourselves, but they wouldn’t
let us. I went over onct where they’d laid
him out for folks to see. I reckon I won’t
tell you about that. I ain’t never goin’ to
get that out of my mind. I wisht a million
times I’d never seen him lyin’ there black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
and changed—that I could only see him
as he looked sayin’ ‘good-by’ to me up
to the Soldiers’ Home in Washington
that night.</p>

<p>“Ma and me didn’t go to the cemetery
with ’em. I couldn’t stan’ it. Didn’t seem
right to have sich goin’s on here at home
where he belonged, for a man like him.
But we go up often now, ma and me does,
and talk about him. Blamed if it don’t
seem sometimes as if he was right there—might
step out any minute and say
‘Hello, Billy, any new stories?’</p>

<p>“Yes. I knowed Abraham Lincoln;
knowed him well; and I tell you there
wan’t never a better man made. Leastwise
I don’t want to know a better one.
He just suited <em>me</em>—Abraham Lincoln
did.”</p>

</div>


<p>Hear ’em? Hear the Lincoln and
Douglas debates? Well, I should say I
did. Heard every one of ’em. Yes, sir,
for about two months back there in ’58,
I didn’t do a thing but travel around Illinois
listenin’ to them two men argue out
slavery; and when I wa’n’t listenin’ to
’em or travelin’ around after ’em, I was
pretty sure to be settin’ on a fence discussin’.
Fur my part I never did understand
how the crops was got in that fall;
seemed to me about all the men in the
state was settin’ around whittlin’ and discussin’.</p>

<p>Made Lincoln? Yes, I reckon you
might say they did. There’s no denyin’
that’s when the country outside begun to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
take notice of him. But don’t you make
no mistake, them debates wa’n’t the beginnin’
of Abraham Lincoln’s work on
slavery. He’d been at it for about four
years before they come off, sweatin’ his
brains night and day. The hardest piece
of thinkin’ I ever see a man do. Anybody
that wants to hear about him back there
needn’t expect stories. He wa’n’t tellin’
stories them days. No, sir, he was
thinkin’.</p>

<p>Curious about him. There he was,
more’n forty-five years old, clean out of
politics and settled down to practice law.
Looked as if he wouldn’t do much of
anything the rest of his life but jog
around the circuit, when all of a suddint
Douglas sprung his Kansas-Nebraska
bill. You remember what that bill was,
don’t you?—let Kansas and Nebraska in
as territories and the same time repealed
the Missouri Compromise keeping slavery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
out of that part of the country, let
the people have it or not, just as they
wanted. You ain’t no idee how that bill
stirred up Mr. Lincoln. I’ll never forgit
how he took its passin’. ’Twas long back
in the spring of ’54. Lot of ’em was settin’
in here tellin’ stories and Mr. Lincoln
was right in the middle of one when in
bounced Billy Herndon—he was Lincoln’s
law partner, you know. His eyes
was blazin’ and he calls out, “They’ve upset
the Missouri Compromise. The Kansas-Nebraska
bill is passed.”</p>

<p>For a minute everybody was still as
death—everybody but me. “Hoorah!” I
calls out, “you can bet on Little Dug
every time,” for I was a Democrat and,
barrin’ George Washington and Thomas
Jefferson, I thought Douglas was the
biggest man God ever made. Didn’t
know no more what that bill meant than
that old Tom-cat in the window.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hoorah!” I says, and then I happened
to look at Mr. Lincoln.</p>

<p>He was all in a heap, his head dropped
down on his breast, and there he set and
never spoke, and then after a long time
he got up and went out. Never finished
that story, never said “Good-by, boys,”
like he always did, never took notice of
nuthin’, just went out, his face gray and
stern, and his eyes not seein’ at all.</p>

<p>Well, sir, you could ’a’ knocked me
over with a feather. I never seen him take
anything that way before. He was a good
loser. You see how ’twas with me, Kansas-Nebraska
wa’n’t nuthin’ but politics,
and my man had beat.</p>

<p>I told Ma about it when I got home.
“It ain’t like him to be mad because
Douglas has beat,” I says, “I don’t
understand it,” and Ma says, “I
reckon that’s just it, William, you
don’t understand it.” Ma was awful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
touchy when anybody seemed to criticise
Mr. Lincoln.</p>

<p>I s’pose you’re too young to recollect
what a fuss that bill stirred up, ain’t you?
Must ’a’ heard your Pa talk about it,
though. Whole North got to rowin’
about it. Out here in Illinois lots of
Democrats left the party on account of it,
and when Douglas came back that summer
they hooted him off a platform up
to Chicago. You couldn’t stop Douglas
that way. That just stirred up his blood.</p>

<p>Far’s I was concerned I couldn’t see
anything the matter with what he’d done.
It seemed all right to me them days to let
the folks that moved into Kansas and
Nebraska do as Douglas had fixed it for
’em, have slaves or not, just as they was
a mind to. And I tell you, when Douglas
came around here and talked about “popular
sovereignty,” and rolled out his big
sentences about the sacred right of self-government,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
and said that if the white
people in Nebraska was good enough to
govern themselves, they was good enough
to govern niggers, I felt dead sure there
wa’n’t no other side to it.</p>

<p>What bothered me was the way Mr.
Lincoln kept on takin’ it. He got so he
wa’n’t the same, ’peared to be in a brown
study all the time. Come in here and set
by the stove with the boys and not talk
at all. Didn’t seem to relish my yarns
either like he used to. He started in campaigning
again, right away, and the boys
said he wouldn’t promise to go any place
where they didn’t let him speak against
the Kansas-Nebraska bill. I heard him
down here that fall—his first big speech.
I hadn’t never had any idee what was in
Abraham Lincoln before. He wa’n’t the
same man at all. Serious—you wouldn’t
believe it, seemed to feel plumb bad about
repealin’ the Missouri Compromise, said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
’twas wrong, just as wrong as ’twould be
to repeal the law against bringing in
slaves from Africa. I must say I hadn’t
thought of that before.</p>

<p>I remember some of the things he said
about Douglas’ idee of popular sovereignty,
just as well as if ’twas yesterday.
“When the white man governs himself,”
he said, “that is self-government; but
when he governs himself and also governs
another, that is more than self-government,
that is despotism.” “If the
negro is a man, then my ancient faith
teaches me that all men are created
equal.” “No man is good enough to
govern another man without that other’s
consent.”</p>

<p>And he just lit into slavery that day.
“I hate it,” he said. “I hate it because it
is a monstrous injustice.” Yes, sir, them’s
the very words he used way back there in
’54. “I hate it because it makes the enemies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
of free institutions call us hypocrites,
I hate it because it makes men criticise
the Declaration of Independence,
and say there ain’t no right principle but
self-interest.” More’n one old abolitionist
who heard that speech said that they
hadn’t no idee how bad slavery was or
how wicked the Kansas-Nebraska bill
was ’til then.</p>

<p>As time went on, seemed as if he got
more serious every day. Everybody got
to noticin’ how hard he was takin’ it. I
remember how Judge Dickey was in here
one day and he says to me, “Billy, Mr.
Lincoln is all used up over this Kansas-Nebraska
business. If he don’t stop worryin’
so, he’ll be sick. Why, t’other night
up to Bloomington, four of us was sleepin’
in the same room and Lincoln talked
us all to sleep, and what do you think? I
waked up about daylight and there he
was settin’ on the side of the bed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
nuthin’ on but his shirt, and when he see
my eyes was open he sings out, ‘I tell
you, Judge, this country can’t last much
longer half-slave and half-free.’ Bin
thinkin’ all night far’s I know.”</p>

<p>Now, sir, that was much as three years
before Mr. Lincoln said them self-same
words in a speech right in this town.
Seems to me I can hear him now singin’
it out shrill and far-soundin’. “A house
divided against itself cannot stand. I believe
this government cannot endure permanently
half-slave and half-free. I do
not expect the house to fall—but I do expect
it will cease to be divided. It will become
all the one thing or all the other.”
Them’s his very words. It made me cold
when I heard ’em. If we wa’n’t goin’ to
git on half-slave and half-free like we’d
always done, what was goin’ to happen?</p>

<p>He hitched on another idee to this one
about our becomin’ all slave or all free,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
which bothered me considerable—that
was, that Douglas and Buchanan and the
rest of the big Democrats was in a conspiracy
to spread slavery all over the
Union. He’d been sayin’ right along that
they didn’t mind slavery spreadin’, but
now he came out flat-footed and said the
things they’d been doin’ in Congress and
in the Supreme Court for a few years
back showed that they was tryin’ to legalize
slavery in all the states, north and
south, old and new. He said that the repeal
of the Missouri Compromise and
Judge Taney’s decision that Congress
couldn’t keep slaves out of a territory—and
the way Pierce and Buchanan had
worked, fitted together like timbers for a
house. “If you see a lot of timbers,” he
says, “all gotten out at different times
and different places by Stephen, Franklin,
Roger and James”—them was the
names of Douglas, Pierce, Taney and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Buchanan, you know—“and you find
they fit into a frame for a house, you
can’t help believing them men have been
workin’ on the same plan.”</p>

<p>I tell you that speech riled his party.
They said he oughtn’t said it, if he did
think it. It was too radical. They talked
to him so much, tryin’ to tone him down
and to keep him from doin’ it ag’in, that
he flared up one day in here and he says,
“Boys, if I had to take a pen and scratch
out every speech I ever made except
one, this speech you don’t like’s the
one I’d leave.” And he says it with
his head up, lookin’ as proud as if he
was a Senator.</p>

<p>Well, somehow, as time went on, just
watchin’ Mr. Lincoln so dead in earnest
begun to make me feel queer. And I got
serious. Never’d been so but twict before
in my life—once at a revival and next
time when I thought I wasn’t goin’ to git<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Ma. But I joined the church and Ma and
me got married, and after that there
didn’t seem to be anything left to worry
about.</p>

<p>And then this comes along, and I’ll be
blamed if it didn’t git so I couldn’t hear
enough of it. Night after night, when
they was in here discussin’, every minute
I wa’n’t puttin’ up something, I was listenin’
to ’em.</p>

<p>And then I took to runnin’ around to
hear the speeches. I was up to Bloomington
in ’56 the time Lincoln went over
to the Republicans. The old Whigs down
here had been considerable worried for
fear he would quit ’em, and I must say it
worried. I never’d had any use for a man
who left his party. Couldn’t understand
it. Seemed to me then that ’twa’n’t no
better than gittin’ a divorce from your
wife. I’ve changed my views since about
several things. Had to jump the party<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
myself two or three times, and I’ve seen
women— Well, all I’ve got to say is, that
I ain’t judgin’ the man that gits a divorce
from ’em.</p>

<p>As I was sayin’, I was up to Bloomington
that night. Nobody that didn’t
hear that speech ever knows what Abraham
Lincoln could do. Lots of ’em will
tell you he was homely. Seems to me
sometimes that’s about all some folks
around here has to tell about Abraham
Lincoln. “Yes, I knowed him,” they say.
“He was the homeliest man in Sangamon
County.” Well, now, don’t you make no
mistake. The folks that don’t tell you
nuthin’ but that never knowed Mr. Lincoln.
Mebbe they’d seen him, but they
never knowed him. He wa’n’t homely.
There’s no denyin’ he was long and lean,
and he didn’t always stand straight and
he wasn’t pertikeler about his clothes,
but that night up to Bloomington in ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
minutes after he struck that platform, I
tell you he was the handsomest man I
ever see.</p>

<p>He knew what he was doin’ that night.
He knew he was cuttin’ loose. He knew
them old Whigs was goin’ to have it in
for him for doin’ it, and he meant to show
’em he didn’t care a red cent what they
thought. He knew there was a lot of
fools in that new party he was joinin’—the
kind that’s always takin’ up with
every new thing comes along to git something
to orate about. He saw clear as day
that if they got started right that night,
he’d got to fire ’em up; and so he threw
back his shoulders and lit in.</p>

<p>Good Lord! I never see anything like
it. In ten minutes he was about eight feet
tall; his face was white, his eyes was blazin’
fire, and he was thunderin’, “Kansas
shall be free!” “Ballots, not bullets!”
“We won’t go out of the Union and you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
sha’n’t!” Generally when he was speakin’,
he was cool and quiet and things all
fit together, and when you come away
you was calm—but your head was workin’;
but that time up to Bloomington he
was like—what’s that the Bible calls it?—“avengin’
fire”—yes, sir, that’s it, he
was like “avengin’ fire.” I never knew
exactly what did happen there. All I
recollect is that at the beginnin’ of that
speech I was settin’ in the back of the
room, and when I come to I was hangin’
on to the front of the platform. I recollect
I looked up and seen Jo Medill
standin’ on the reporter’s table lookin’
foolish-like and heard him say: “Good
Lord, boys, I ain’t took a note!”</p>

<p>Fact was he’d stampeded that audience,
reporters and all. I’ve always
thought that speech made the Republican
party in Illinois. It melted ’em together.
’Twa’n’t arguments they needed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
just then, it was meltin’ together of what
they’d heard.</p>

<p>Well, he went right on speakin’ after
that, must ’a’ made forty or fifty speeches
all over the State, for Fremont, and
he got no end of invitations from Indiana
and Iowa and Kansas and all around to
come over and speak. Old Billy Herndon
used to come in here and brag about
it. You’d thought ’twas him was gittin’
’em. Always seemed to think he owned
Lincoln anyway.</p>

<p>By the time the Republicans wanted a
man for United States Senate Lincoln
was first choice, easy enough, and the first
thing anybody knew if he didn’t up and
challenge Douglas, who the Democrats
was runnin’, to seven debates—seven
joint debates, they called ’em. You could
’a’ knocked me over with a feather when
I heard that. I couldn’t think of anybody
I knew challengin’ Mr. Douglas. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
seemed impertinent, him bein’ what I
thought him. But I was glad they was
goin’ to thresh it out. You see I was feelin’
mighty uncertain in my mind by this
time. Somehow I couldn’t seem to git
around the p’ints I’d been hearin’ Mr.
Lincoln make so much. However, I
didn’t have no idee but what Mr. Douglas
would show clear enough where he
was wrong. So when I heard about
the debates, I says to Ma, “Johnnie
can take care of the store, I’m goin’
to hear ’em.”</p>

<p>You ain’t no idee how people was
stirred up by the news. Seemed as if
everybody in the State felt about as I did.
Most everybody was pretty sober about
it, too. There ain’t no denyin’ that there
was a lot of Democrats just like me.
What Mr. Lincoln had been sayin’ for
four years back had struck in and they
was worried. Still I reckon the most of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
the Republicans was a blamed sight more
uneasy than we was. They’d got so used
to seein’ Douglas git everything he went
after, that they thought he’d be sure to
lick Lincoln now. I heard ’em talkin’
about it among themselves every now and
then and sayin’, “I wisht Lincoln hadn’t
done it. He ain’t had experience like
Douglas. Why, Douglas’s been debatin’
fer twelve years in the United States
Senate with the biggest men in the country,
and he’s always come out ahead.
Lincoln ain’t got a show.”</p>

<p>You needn’t think Mr. Lincoln didn’t
know how they was talkin’. He never
made no mistake about himself, Mr. Lincoln
didn’t. He knew he wa’n’t a big gun
like Douglas. I could see he was blue as
a whetstone sometimes, thinkin’ of the
difference between ’em. “What’s ag’in
us in this campaign, boys,” I heard him
say one day, “is me. There ain’t no use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
denyin’ that Douglas has always been a
big success and I’ve always been a flat
failure. Everybody expects him to be
President and always has and is actin’
accordin’. Nobody’s ever expected anything
from me. I tell you we’ve got to
run this campaign on principle. There
ain’t nuthin’ in your candidate.” And he
looked so cast down I felt plum sorry for
him.</p>

<p>But you needn’t think by that that he
was shirkin’ it—no, sir, not a mite. Spite
of all his blues, he’d set his teeth for a
fight. One day over to the Chenery
House I recollect standin’ with two or
three Republicans when Mr. Lincoln
come along and stopped to shake hands
with a chap from up to Danville. “How’s
things lookin’ up your way, Judge?” he
says.</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Lincoln,” the Judge says,
“we’re feelin’ mighty anxious about this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
debate of yourn with Douglas,” and the
way he said it I could ’a’ kicked him.</p>

<p>Mr. Lincoln looked at him mighty
sober for a minute. “Judge,” he says,
“didn’t you ever see two men gittin’
ready for a fight? Ain’t you seen one of
’em swell up his muscle and pat it and
brag how he’s goin’ to knock the stuffin’
out of the other, and that other man
clinchin’ his fist and settin’ his teeth and
savin’ his wind. Well, sir, the other is
goin’ to win the fight or die tryin’,” and
with that he turns and goes off.</p>

<p>Didn’t I know that’s the way he felt.
I hadn’t been watchin’ him sweatin’ his
brains on that darned question for four
years without knowin’. I tell you nobody
that didn’t see him often them days, and
didn’t care enough about him to feel bad
when he felt bad, can ever understand
what Abraham Lincoln went through
before his debates with Douglas. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
worked his head day and night tryin’ to
git that slavery question figured out so
nobody could stump him. Greatest man
to think things out so nobody could git
around him I ever see. Hadn’t any patience
with what wa’n’t clear. What worried
him most, I can see now, was makin’
the rest of us understand it like he did.</p>

<p>Well, as I was sayin’, it seemed as if
all Illinois turned out to hear ’em speak.
A country fair wa’n’t nuthin’ to the
crowds. There wa’n’t any too many railroads
in Illinois in ’58, and they didn’t
select the places fur the debates accordin’
to connections. I reckon I traveled about
all the ways there be gettin’ to the places:
foot, horseback, canal-boat, stage, side-wheeler,
just got around any way that
come handy; et and slept the same. Up
to Quincy I recollect I put up on the
bluff, and over to Charlestown me and
seven of the boys had two beds. Nobody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
seemed to mind. We was all too took up
with the speeches, seemed as if the more
you heard the more you wanted to hear.
I tell you they don’t have no such
speeches nowadays. There ain’t two men
in the United States today could git the
crowds them two men had or hold ’em if
they got ’em.</p>

<p>I sort of expected some new line of
argument from Douglas when they
started out, but ’twa’n’t long before we
all saw he wa’n’t goin’ to talk about anything
but popular sovereignty—that is, if
he could help himself. As it turned out he
didn’t git his way. Mr. Lincoln had made
up his mind that the Judge had got to say
whether he thought slavery was right or
wrong. Accordin’ to him, that was the
issue of the campaign. He argued that
Douglas’ notion of popular sovereignty
was all right if slavery was as good as
freedom, but that if it wa’n’t, his arguments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
wa’n’t worth a rush. He said the
difference between him and the Judge
was that one thought slavery was wrong
and ought to be kept where it was till it
died out of itself, and the other thought
it was right and ought to be spread all
over the country.</p>

<p>It made Little Dug awful mad to face
that line of argument. He said such talk
proved Lincoln was an abolitionist, and
as for his bein’ in a conspiracy to spread
slavery it was a lie, “an infamous lie.”
Well, I always did think conspiracy was
a pretty strong word for Lincoln to use.
Strictly speakin’, I reckon ’twa’n’t one,
but all the same it didn’t look right.
Douglas couldn’t deny that when he got
the Missouri Compromise repealed he
let slavery into territory that the government
had set aside to be free. He couldn’t
deny that Judge Taney had decided that
Congress couldn’t prevent people takin’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
slaves into this territory. There was some
other things which fitted in with these
which Douglas couldn’t deny.</p>

<p>Mr. Lincoln argued from what they’d
done that there wa’n’t any reason why
they shouldn’t go on and apply the same
legislation to all the other free parts of
the country, said he believed they would
in time if they thought it would pay
better.</p>

<p>The more I heard ’em argue the more
I felt Lincoln was right. Suppose, I
says to myself, that they take it into their
heads to open Illinois? What’s to stop
’em? If slaves can be took into Nebraska
by the divine right of self-government,
what’s to prevent the divine right of self-government
lettin’ ’em in here? Of
course, there was an old law settin’ aside
the Northwest to freedom, but if the Missouri
Compromise could be repealed, why
couldn’t that? Then, again, what’s to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
prevent the Supreme Court decidin’ that
Congress couldn’t keep slaves out of a
state just as it had decided that Congress
couldn’t keep ’em out of a territory. The
more I thought of it the more I see there
wa’n’t anything to prevent men like
Douglas and Buchanan tryin’ some day
to apply the same line of argument to Illinois
or Pennsylvania or New York or
any other free state that they was usin’
now.</p>

<p>I wa’n’t goin’ to stand for that. I don’t
pretend I ever felt like Mr. Lincoln did
about niggers. No, sir, I was a Democrat,
and I wanted the South let alone.
I didn’t want to hear no abolition talk.
But I was dead agin’ havin’ any more
slaves than we could help, and what’s
more I wa’n’t myself willin’ to live in a
state where they was. I’d seen enough
for that. Back in the ’40’s, when I first
started up this store, I used to go to New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Orleans for my goods and, bein’ young,
of course I had to see the sights. A man
don’t go to a slave market many times
without gittin’ to feel that as far as he is
concerned he don’t want nuthin’ to do
with buyin’ and sellin’ humans, black or
white. Ma, too, she was dead set agin’ it,
and she’d said many a time when I was
talkin’, “William, if Mr. Douglas don’t
really care whether we git to be all slave
or not, you oughten to vote for him,” and
I’d always said I wouldn’t. Still I
couldn’t believe at first but what he did
care. By the time the debates was half
through I seen it clear enough, though.
He didn’t care a red cent—said he didn’t.
There was lots of others seen it same as
me. I heard more’n one old Democrat
say, “Douglas don’t care. Lincoln’s got
it right, we’ve got to keep slavery back
now or it’s going to spread all over the
country.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>You never would believe how I felt
when I seen that, for that meant goin’
back on Little Dug, leavin’ the party and
votin’ for a Black Republican, as we used
to call ’em. I tell you when I begun to
see where I was goin’ there wa’n’t many
nights I didn’t lie awake tryin’ to figure
out how I could git around it. ’Twa’n’t
long, though, before I got over feelin’
bad. Fact was every time I heard Mr.
Lincoln—I used to go to all the speeches
between debates, and there must have
been twenty or thirty of them—he made
it clearer. ’Twas amazin’ how every time
he always had some new way of puttin’
it. Seemed as if his head was so full he
couldn’t say the same thing twice alike.</p>

<p>One thing that made it easier was that
I begun to see that Douglas wa’n’t thinkin’
much of anything but gittin elected
and that Lincoln wa’n’t thinkin’ about
that at all. He was dead set on makin’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
us understand. Lots of people seen that
the first thing. I recollect how up to
Quincy that funny fellow, what do you
call him? “Nasby-Petroleum V. Nasby.”
Young chap then. Well, he’d come out
there for some paper. Wanted to write
Lincoln up. It was in the evening after
the debate and Mr. Lincoln was settin’
up in his room, at the hotel with his boots
off and his feet on a chair—lettin’ ’em
breathe, he said. Had his coat and vest
off. Nuthin’ on to speak of but his pants
and one suspender—settin’ there restin’
and gassin’ with the boys when, as I
started to say, Mr. Nasby come up. They
had a long talk and I walked down street
with him when he left.</p>

<p>“That Lincoln of yourn is a great
man,” he says after a spell. “He ain’t
botherin’ about the Senate—not a mite.
He’s tryin’ to make the people of Illinois
understand the danger there is in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
slavery spreadin’ all over the country.
He’s a big man, the biggest man I’ve
seen in a long time.”</p>

<p>Well, that sounded good to me, for
that was just about what I’d figured out
by that time, that Lincoln was a big man,
a bigger man than Stephen A. Douglas.
Didn’t seem possible to me it could be so,
but the more I went over it in my mind
the more certain I felt about it. Yes, sir,
I’d figured it out at last what bein’ big
was, that it was bein’ right thinkin’
things out straight and then hangin’ on
to ’em because they was right. That was
bein’ big and that was Abraham Lincoln
all through—the whole of him.</p>

<p>That wa’n’t Douglas at all. He didn’t
care whether he thought right or not, if
he got what he was after. There wa’n’t
no real truth in him. See what he did in
the very first debate up to Ottawa. He
started out up there by callin’ Lincoln an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
abolitionist and sayin’ he wanted a nigger
wife, and to prove it read a lot of abolition
resolutions which, he said Lincoln
had helped git up as far back as ’54. The
very next day after that debate, the Chicago
<cite>Tribune</cite> came out and showed that
Mr. Lincoln hadn’t ever had anything to
do with the resolutions Douglas had read.
Yes, sir, them resolutions had come from
some measely abolition meetin’ where
Mr. Lincoln had never been. Douglas
had been tryin’ to play a trick on us. I
tell you when that news got out you
could ’a’ heard a pin drop among Illinois
Democrats. It seemed as if he couldn’t
realize how serious we was feelin’ or he
wouldn’t try a trick like that.</p>

<p>Then he was always draggin’ in things
which didn’t have no bearin’ on the case,
and takin’ up Lincoln’s time makin’ him
answer ’em. One was a-tellin’ how Lincoln
had voted against givin’ money to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
carry on the Mexican War. Now, I know
that wa’n’t so, and more’n that it didn’t
have anything to do with the question.
It made me feel plumb bad to have him
goin’ on that way.</p>

<p>And that’s the way he kept it up. Always
digressin’, never takin’ up a p’int
till Lincoln had drove him into a corner,
always insistin’ Lincoln wanted a nigger
wife. Why, he made so much of that fool
lie that there was a lot of people got to
thinkin’ mebbe that’s what Lincoln’s
idees did mean. There’s a man livin’ here
in this town now that’s got a little book
Lincoln made for him to show around
and to prove he didn’t mean nuthin’ of
the kind.</p>

<p>Fact was, Douglas never meant to
argue it out fair and square. He meant
to dodge, to mix us up and keep our
minds off Kansas-Nebraska and old
Judge Taney, and all the things Lincoln<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
made so much of. I recollect Lincoln said
one day that the way Douglas acted reminded
him of a cuttle-fish throwin’ out
a black ink to color up the water so he
could git away from something that was
chasin’ him.</p>

<p>Of course what made Douglas seem
worse was Lincoln bein’ so fair and so
dead in earnest. Sometimes it seemed as
if he was givin’ the whole case away, he
was so honest with Douglas. But he
knew what he was doin’ every time. Lincoln
was the kind that breaks to win.
And serious, why he wouldn’t take time
to tell a story. I recollect sayin’ to him
one day, “Mr. Lincoln, why don’t you
make us laugh sometimes?” “This ain’t
no time for stories, Billy,” he says, “it’s
too serious.”</p>

<p>Felt bad because he wa’n’t elected?
Nope. Didn’t expect him to be. Somehow
I’d got to feelin’ by the time election<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
come that it didn’t make no real difference
whether he went to the Senate or
not. His goin’ there wa’n’t goin’ to settle
the question. What was goin’ to settle it
was gettin’ more people to feel as he did
about it. If he got beat tryin’ to make
people understand, it was worth a sight
more to the country than his gettin’
elected dodgin’ the truth. I didn’t figure
that out alone, though, it was Mr. Lincoln
helped me to see that.</p>

<p>You see, after I’d made up my mind
I’d vote the Republican ticket, one day
when I was walkin’ down the street with
him here in town and there wa’n’t nobody
around I told him. He looks at me sharp-like
and then he says, mighty solemn:
“Billy, are you sure you know what
you’re doin’? What’s the reason you’re
leavin’ the party? ’Cause you want to see
me git in?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” I says, “that ain’t it at all.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
I’m a Democrat. Besides, I hate like all
possessed to go back on Little Doug, you
know what store I’ve always set by him.
The reason I’m votin’ for you, Mr. Lincoln,
is because you’ve got it right and
nobody can git around it. Douglas is
wrong. There ain’t nuthin’ else to do but
vote for your side, much as I hate to.”</p>

<p>Well, sir, you never seen how he
straightened up and how his eyes lit up
like I’d seen ’em do when he was speakin’.</p>

<p>“Billy,” he says, “I’d ruther hear you
say that than anything anybody could
say. That’s what I’ve been tryin’ to do—to
make people see it as I do. I believe
I’ve got it figured out right, Billy. I’ve
been at it night and day for four years,
and I can’t find no mistake in my line of
argument. What I want is to make people
understand.”</p>

<p>“What bothers me, Mr. Lincoln,” I
says, “is that I don’t believe you’ll git<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
elected, even if you are right,” and then,
sir, he throws back his head and just
laffs right out loud. “Don’t worry, Billy,
about that,” he says, “that don’t make
no difference. I ain’t sayin’ I don’t want
to go to the United States Senate—I do!
Always have. When I quit politics in
’49 and made up my mind I wa’n’t goin’
to have another chanct to go to Congress
or be anybody, I was miserable. But
that’s all over. What’s important now in
this country is makin’ people feel that
slavery is wrong, that the South is bent
on spreadin’ it and that we’ve got to stop
’em. Slavery is wrong, Billy, if it ain’t
wrong nuthin’ is. We’ve got to fight
against its spreadin’, and it’s goin’ to be
a durable struggle. It don’t make no
difference who gits office or who don’t.
All that’s important is keepin’ on fightin’.
Don’t you worry if I ain’t elected.
The fight’s goin’ on.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>Well, I thought that over a lot, and it
was queer how calm I came to feel—calm
and sure, just as you be about God
and all that. And when he was defeated
I didn’t seem to mind—any more’n he
did. There wa’n’t hardly anybody could
understand why he took it so easy, and
he had to go around consolin’ ’em an’
stiffenin’ ’em up and tellin’ ’em as he had
me, how it was a durable struggle—that’s
the word he always used—“durable.”
Always seemed to me it was exactly the
word for it—something that wa’n’t going
to wear out.</p>

<p>Ever see Douglas after that? Yes,
onct. One day after election he come in
here, and after talkin’ around a spell he
says suddint:</p>

<p>“Billy, you supported Mr. Lincoln,
didn’t you?” And he looked me straight
in the eye, kind, but meanin’ to know
from me. Well, you bet I’d liked to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
lied, but that ain’t the kind of a thing a
man lies about.</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Douglas,” I says, “I did, I
had to. He had it right.”</p>

<p>Well, sir, you never see the way he
smiled at me. “That’s right, Billy,” he
says, “I understand,” and then he grips
my hand and turns on his heel and goes
off with his head down.</p>

<p>Seemed to me I couldn’t stand it. You
see I’d always loved Little Dug, and I’d
been proud of him. Lordy, sometimes
when he’d come back from Washington
in them old days and come in here, all
dressed up and lookin’ so handsome and
great, and come up and put his arm
around me and ask about Ma and Johnnie
and how business was, I’ll be blamed
if I didn’t git red as a girl, I was so
pleased. I’d hurrahed for him and voted
for him for years, and here I had gone
back on him. It just made me sick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>I couldn’t stand it to stay in the store,
so I put on my hat and went home and
told Ma. “I almost wisht I hadn’t done
it,” I says, groanin’.</p>

<p>“William,” Ma says, “you know well
enough you couldn’t have done nuthin’
else. I don’t understand these things
none too well. ’Tain’t a woman’s business;
but you done what you thought was right
and you ain’t no call to worry about doin’
what you think is right.” That’s the
way Ma always talks. You ought to
know Ma.</p>

<p>Still there ain’t no use denyin’ it. I
don’t ever think about the last time I seen
Little Dug without feelin’ bad. I never
could be hard on him like some was for
that Kansas-Nebraska bill. You see, fact
was he thought he was doin’ a fine thing
when he got up that bill. He seen the
South wa’n’t satisfied, and he thought
he’d fix up something to please ’em and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
keep ’em still a while—a kind of Daniel
Webster he was tryin’ to be, makin’ a
new compromise.</p>

<p>Douglas got so busy tryin’ to please
the South he clean lost sight of what the
people was thinkin’ back home. I reckon
he wan’t countin’ on us thinkin’ at all—just
took it for granted we’d believe
what he told us, like we’d always done.
Surprisin’ how long you can fool people
with the talk they was brought up on.
Seems sometimes as if they hated to
break in a new set of idees as bad as they
do new boots. I reckon that was what
Douglas was countin’ on back there
in ’58. But he got it wrong that time.
He hadn’t reckoned on what Abraham
Lincoln had been doin’. Before he got
through them debates, Douglas suspected
it in my judgment. He knew
that even if he did git to the Senate, Lincoln
was the one that had come out ahead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>Queer how every day after that election,
it showed up more and more that
Lincoln was ahead. Seemed sometimes
that as if everybody in the whole North
was bent on hearin’ him speak. Why,
they sent for him to come to New York
and Boston, and all the big men East got
to writin’ to him, and the first thing I
knowed the boys was talkin’ about his
bein’ President.</p>

<p>Well, I thought that was goin’ a leetle
far. Just as I told you t’other day, it
seemed to me almost as if somebody was
pokin’ fun at him. He didn’t seem to me
to look like a President. Queer how long
it takes a man to find out that there ain’t
anything in the world so important as
honest thinkin’ and actin’, and that when
you’ve found a man that never lets up
’til he sees clear and right, and then hangs
on to what he sees like a dog to a root,
you can’t make a mistake in tyin’ to him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
You can trust him anywhere. Queer how
long we are all taken in by high-soundin’
talk and fashionable ways and fine promises.
But don’t you make no mistake,
they ain’t no show in the long run with
honest thinkin’.</p>

<p>I don’t believe a man ever lived
who’d rather seen everybody happy and
peaceable than Abraham Lincoln. He
never could stand it to have people sufferin’
or not gettin’ what they wanted.
Time and time again I’ve seen him go
taggin’ up street here in this town after
some youngster that was blubberin’ because
he couldn’t have what wa’n’t good
for him. Seemed as if he couldn’t rest

as natural for him to be that way as ’twas
for him to eat or drink.</p>

<p>Yes, I suppose bein’ like that <em>did</em> make
the war harder on him. But he had horse
sense as well as a big heart, Mr. Lincoln
had. He knew you couldn’t have war
without somebody gettin’ hurt. He <em>expected</em>
sufferin’, but he knew ’twas his
business not to have any more than was
necessary and to take care of what come.
And them was two things that wa’n’t done
like they ought to ’a’ been. That was
what worried him.</p>

<p>Seemed as if hardly anybody at the
start had any idea of how important ’twas
to take good care of the boys and keep ’em
from gettin’ sick or if they did get sick to
cure ’em. I remember Leonard Swett was
in here one day ’long back in ’61 and he
says; “Billy, Mr. Lincoln knows more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
about how the soldiers in the Army of
the Potomac cook flapjacks than you do
about puttin’ up quinine. There ain’t a
blamed thing they do in that army that he
ain’t interested in. I went down to camp
with him one day and I never see an old
hunter in the woods quicker to spot a rabbit’s
track than he was every little kink
about the housekeepin’. When we got
back to town he just sat and talked and
talked about the way the soldiers was livin’,
seemed to know all about ’em everyways:
where they was short of shoes,
where the rations were poor, where they
had camp-fever worst; told me how hardtack
was made, what a good thing quinine
and onions are to have handy,—best cure
for diarrhea, sore feet, homesickness,
everything. I never heard anything like
it.”</p>

<p>Seemed to bother Swett a little that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
Mr. Lincoln took so much interest in all
them little things, but I said: “Don’t you
worry, Mr. Swett, Mr. Lincoln’s got the
right idee. An army that don’t have its
belly and feet taken care of ain’t goin’ to
do much fightin’, and Mr. Lincoln’s got
sense enough to know it. He knows diarrhea’s
a blamed sight more dangerous to
the Army of the Potomac than Stonewall
Jackson. Trouble so far has been, in <em>my</em>
judgment, that the people that ought to
have been seein’ to what the soldiers was
eatin’ and drinkin’ and whether their beds
was dry and their bowels movin’, was
spendin’ their time polishin’ their buttons
and shinin’ their boots for parade.”</p>

<p>“What I don’t see,” says Swett, “is
how he learned all the things he knows.
They ain’t the kind of things you’d naturally
think a president of the United
States would be interestin’ himself in.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>There ’twas,—same old fool notion that
a president ought to sit inside somewhere
and think about the Constitution. I used
to be that way—always saw a president
lookin’ like that old picture of Thomas
Jefferson up there settin’ beside a parlor
table holdin’ a roll of parchment in his
hand, and Leonard Swett was like me a
little in spite of his bein’ educated.</p>

<p>Learned it! Think of Leonard Swett
askin’ that with all <em>his</em> chances of bein’
with Mr. Lincoln! Learned it just as he
had everything by bein’ so dead interested.
He’d learned it if he hadn’t been president
at all, if he’d just been loafin’ around
Washington doin’ nuthin’. Greatest hand
to take notice of things. I tell you he’d
made a great war correspondent. Things
he’d ’a’ seen! And the way he’d ’a’ told
’em! I can just see him now pumpin’
everybody that had been to the front.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Great man to make you talk, Mr. Lincoln
was. I’ve heard him say himself that
most of the education he had he’d got from
people who thought they was learnin’
from him.</p>

<p>I reckon he learned a lot more from soldiers
about how the armies was bein’ taken
care of than he did from generals. My
brother Isaac, who had a place down there
addin’ up figgers or something used to tell
me of seein’ Mr. Lincoln stoppin’ ’em on
the street and out around the White
House and talkin’ to ’em. Isaac said
’twa’n’t becomin’ in the President of the
United States to be so familiar with common
soldiers, he ought to keep among the
generals and members of the administration.
Isaac always reckoned <em>himself</em> a
member of the administration.</p>

<p>“More than that,” says Isaac, “it ain’t
dignified for a president to be always runnin’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
out after things himself instead of
sendin’ somebody. He’s always goin’
over to the telegraph office with messages,
and settin’ down by the operators talkin’
and readin’ dispatches and waitin’ for answers.
One day he came right up to my
office to ask me to look up the record of
Johnnie Banks, old Aunt Sally Banks’
boy, that was goin’ to be shot for desertion.
Seemed to think I’d be interested because
he came from Illinois—came right
up there instead of sendin’ for me to go to
the White House like he ought to, and
when I took what I found over to him and
he found out Johnnie wa’n’t but eighteen,
he put on his hat and went over himself
to the telegraph office, took me along, and
sent a message that I saw, sayin’, ‘<em>I don’t
want anybody as young as eighteen to be
shot</em>.’ And that night he went back and
sent another message askin’ if they’d received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
the first—wasn’t satisfied till he
knew it couldn’t happen. There wa’n’t
any reason why he should spend his time
that way. He ought to give orders and
let other folks see they’re carried out.
That’s what I’d do if I was president.”</p>

<p>That riled me. “I reckon there ain’t
any need to worry about <em>that</em>, Isaac,” I
says. “You won’t never be president.
Mr. Lincoln’s got too many folks around
him now that don’t do nuthin’ but give
orders. That’s one reason he has to do
his own executin’.”</p>

<p>But ’twas just like him to go and do it
himself. So interested he <em>had</em> to see to it.
I’ve heard different ones tell time and time
again that whenever he’d pardoned a soldier
he couldn’t rest till he’d get word
back that ’twas all right. Did you ever
hear about that Vermont boy in McClellan’s
army, sentenced to be shot along at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
the start for sleepin’ on his post. ’Twas
when they was camped over in Virginia
right near Washington. Mr. Lincoln
didn’t know about it till late and when he
heard the story he telegraphed down not
to do it. Then he telegraphed askin’ if
they’d got his orders and when he didn’t
get an answer what does he do but get in
his carriage and drive himself ten miles to
camp to see that they didn’t do it. Now
that’s what I call bein’ a real president.
<em>That’s</em> executin’.</p>

<p>Well, as I was sayin’, <em>he</em> understood
the importance of a lot of things them
young officers and some of the old ones
didn’t see at all, and he knew where to get
the truth about ’em—went right to the soldiers
for it. They was just like the folks
he was used to, and Mr. Lincoln was the
greatest hand for folks—just plain common
folks—you ever see. He liked ’em,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
never forgot ’em, just natural nice to
’em.</p>

<p>It used to rile old Judge Davis a lot
when they was travelin’ the circuit, the way
Mr. Lincoln never made no difference between
lawyers and common folks. I heard
Judge Logan tellin’ in here one day about
their all bein’ in the tavern up to Bloomington
one day. In those times there was
just one big table for everybody. The
lawyers and big bugs always set at one
end and the teamsters and farmers at the
other. Mr. Lincoln used to like to get
down among the workin’ folks and get the
news. Reckon he got kinda tired hearin’
discussin’ goin’ on all the time. Liked to
hear about the crops and politics and folks
he knew.</p>

<p>This time he was down among ’em, and
Judge Davis, who always wanted Lincoln
right under his nose, calls out: “Come up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
here, Mr. Lincoln; here’s where you belong.”
And Mr. Lincoln, he looked kinda
funny at the Judge and he says:</p>

<p>“Got anything better to eat up there,
Judge?” And everybody tee-heed.</p>

<p>Feelin’ as he did about folks I could
see how it would go ag’in the grain for
the boys in the army to have a harder time
than was necessary. He’d argue that they
was doin’ the fightin’ and ought to have
the care. He’d feel a good deal worse
about their bein’ neglected than he would
about the things he knew beforehand he
had to stand, like woundin’ and killin’.
And ’twas just that way so I found out
the time I was down to Washington visitin’
him.</p>

<p>I told you, didn’t I, how I went up to
the Soldiers’ Home and how we walked
out that night and sat and talked till almost
mornin’? ’Twas a clear night with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
lots of stars and Washington looked
mighty pretty lyin’ there still and white.
Mr. Lincoln pointed out the Capitol and
the White House and Arlington and the
Long Bridge, showin’ me the lay of the
land.</p>

<p>“And it’s nuthin’ but one big hospital,
Billy,” he said after a while. “You
wouldn’t think, would you, lookin’ down
on it so peaceful and quiet, that there’s
50,000 sick and wounded soldiers there?
Only Almighty God knows how many of
’em are dyin’ this minute; only Almighty
God knows how many are sufferin’ so
they’re prayin’ to die. They are comin’
to us every day now—have been ever since
the Wilderness, 50,000 here and 150,000
scattered over the country. There’s a
crawlin’ line of sick and wounded all the
way from here to Petersburg to-night.
There’s a line, from Georgia to Chattanooga—Sherman’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
men. You can’t put
your finger on a spot in the whole North
that ain’t got a crippled or fever-struck
soldier in it. There were days in May,
just after the Wilderness, when Mary and
I used to drive the carriage along lines of
ambulances which stretched from the
docks to the hospitals, one, two miles.
It was a thing to tear your heart out to
see them. They brought them from the
field just as they picked them up, with
horrible, gaping, undressed wounds, blood
and dust and powder caked over them—eaten
by flies and mosquitoes. They’d
been piled like cord wood on flat cars and
transports. Sometimes they didn’t get a
drink until they were distributed here.
Often when it was cold they had no blanket,
when it was hot they had no shade.
That was nearly four months ago, and
still they come. Night after night as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
drive up here from the White House I
pass twenty, thirty, forty ambulances in
a row distributin’ the wounded and sick
from Grant’s army.</p>

<p>“Think what it means! It means that
boys like you and me were, not so long
ago, have stood up and shot each other
down—have trampled over each other and
have left each other wounded and bleeding
on the ground, in the rain or the heat,
nobody to give ’em a drink or to say a
kind word. Nothing but darkness and
blood and groans and torture. Sometimes
I can’t believe it’s true. Boys from
Illinois where I live, shootin’ boys from
Kentucky where I was born! It’s only
when I see them comin’ in I realize it—boat
load after boat load, wagon load
after wagon load. It seemed sometimes
after Bull Run and Fredericksburg and
Chancellorsville if they didn’t stop unloadin’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
’em I’d go plumb crazy. But still they
come, and only God knows when they’ll
stop. They say hell’s like war, Billy. If
’tis,—I’m glad I ain’t Satan.”</p>

<p>Of course I tried to cheer him up. I’d
been around visitin’ the Illinois boys in
the hospitals that day and I just lit in and
told him how comfortable I’d found ’em
and how chipper most of them seemed.
“You’d think ’twas fun to be in the hospital
to see some of ’em, Mr. Lincoln,”
I said. “What do you suppose old Tom
Blodgett was doin’? Settin’ up darnin’
his socks. Yes, sir, insisted on doin’ it
himself. Said them socks had fit all the
way from Washington to Richmond.
They’d stood by him and he was goin’ to
stand by them. Goin’ to dress their
wounds as good as the doctor had his.
Never saw anything so funny as that big
feller propped up there tryin’ to darn like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
he’d seen his mother do and all the time
makin’ fun. All the boys around were
laffin’ at him—called him the sock doctor.</p>

<p>“And things were so clean and white
and pretty and the women were runnin’
around just like home.”</p>

<p>“God bless ’em,” he said. “I don’t
know what we’d ’a’ done if it hadn’t been
for the way the women have taken hold.
Come down here willin’ to do anything;
women that never saw a cut finger before,
will stand over a wound so terrible men
will faint at the sight of it. I’ve known
of women spendin’ whole nights on a battlefield
huntin’ for somebody they’d lost
and stoppin’ as they went to give water
and take messages. I’ve known ’em to
work steady for three days and nights
without a wink of sleep down at the front
after a battle, takin’ care of the wounded.
Here in Washington you can’t stop ’em<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
as long as they can see a thing to be done.
At home they’re supportin’ the families
and workin’ day and night to help us.
They give their husbands and their boys
and then themselves. God bless the women,
Billy. We can’t save the Union
without ’em.</p>

<p>“It makes a difference to the boys in a
hospital havin’ ’em. People don’t realize
how young this army is. Half the
wounded here in Washington to-day are
<em>children</em>—not twenty yet—lots of ’em
under eighteen. Children who never went
to sleep in their lives before they went
into the army without kissin’ their mothers
good-night. You take such a boy as that
and let him lie in camp a few months
gettin’ more and more tired of it and he
gets homesick—plain homesick—he wants
his mother. Perhaps he don’t know
what’s the matter and he wouldn’t admit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
it if he did. First thing you know he’s
in the hospital with camp fever, or he gets
wounded. I tell you a woman looks good
to him.</p>

<p>“It’s a queer thing to say, Billy, but I
get real comfort out of the hospitals.
When you know what the wounded have
been through—how they have laid on the
battlefields for hours and hours uncared
for, how they’ve suffered bein’ hauled up
here, there ain’t nuthin’ consoles you like
knowin’ that their wounds have been
dressed and that they are clean and fed,
and looked after. Then they are so thankful
to be here—to have some one to see to
’em. I remember one day a boy who had
been all shot up but was gettin’ better
sayin’ to me: ‘Mr. Lincoln, I can’t sleep
nights thinkin’ how comfortable I am.’
It’s so good to find ’em realizin’ that
everybody cares—the whole country.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
People come and read to ’em and write
letters for ’em and bring ’em things.
Why, they have real good times at some
of the places. Down to Armory Square
Bliss has got a melodeon and they have
concerts sometimes, and there are flags
up and flowers in the windows. I got
some flower seeds last summer for Bliss
to plant outside, but they turned out to
be lettuce and onions. The boys ate ’em
and you ought to heard ’em laugh about
my flowers. I tell you it makes me happy
when I go around and find the poor fellows
smilin’ up at me and sayin’: ‘You’re
takin’ good care of us, Mr. Lincoln,’ and
maybe crack a joke.</p>

<p>“They take it all so natural, trampin’
and fightin’ and dyin’. It’s a wonderful
army—wonderful! You couldn’t believe
that boys that back home didn’t ever have
a serious thought in their heads could ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
be so dead set as they be about an idee.
Think of it! A million men are lookin’
up at these stars to-night, a million men
ready to die for the Union to-morrow if
it’s got to be done to save it! I tell you,
it shows what’s in ’em. They’re all the
same, young or old—the Union’s got to
be saved! Of course you’d expect it more
of the old ones, and we’ve got some old
ones, older than the law allows, too.
’Tain’t only the youngsters who have lied
themselves into the service. Only to-day
a Congressman was in tellin’ me about
one of his constituents, said he was over
sixty-five and white-haired when he first
enlisted. They refused him of course,
and I’ll be blamed if the old fellow didn’t
dye his hair black and change his name,
and when they asked him his age, said:
‘Rising thirty-five,’ and he’s been fightin’
good for two years and now they’d found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
him out. The Congressman asked me
what he ought to do. I told him if ’twas
me I’d keep him in hair dye.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We was still a while and then Mr. Lincoln
began talkin’, more to himself than to
me.</p>

<p>“A million men, a mighty host—and
one word of mine would bring the million
sleeping boys to their feet—send them
without a word to their guns—they would
fall in rank—regiment on regiment, brigade
on brigade, corps on corps, a word
more and they would march steady, quiet,
a million men in step straight ahead, over
fields, through forests, across rivers.
Nothing could stop them—cannons might
tear holes in their ranks, and they would
fill them up, a half million might be bled
out of them, and a word of mine would
bring a half million more to fill their place.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
Oh, God, my God,” he groaned, under his
breath, “what am I that Thou shouldst
ask this of me! What am I that Thou
shouldst trust me so!”</p>

<p>Well, I just dropped my head in my
hands—seemed as if I oughten to look at
him—and the next thing I knew Mr. Lincoln’s
arm was over my shoulder and he
was saying in that smilin’ kind of voice he
had: “Don’t mind me, Billy. The Lord
generally knows what He’s about and He
can get rid of me quick enough if He sees
I ain’t doin’ the job—quicker than the
Copperheads can.”</p>

<p>Just like him to change so. Didn’t
want anybody to feel bad. But I never
forgot that, and many a time in my sleep
I’ve heard Abraham Lincoln’s voice crying
out: “Oh, God, my God, what am I
that Thou shouldst ask this of me!” and
I’ve groaned to think how often through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
them four awful years he must have lifted
up his face with that look on it and asked
the Lord what in the world he was doing
that thing for.</p>

<p>“After all, Billy,” he went on, “it’s
surprisin’ what a happy army it is. In
spite of bein’ so dead in earnest and havin’
so much trouble of one kind and another,
seems sometimes as if you couldn’t put
’em anywhere that they wouldn’t scare up
some fun. Greatest chaps to sing on the
march, to cut up capers and play tricks
you ever saw. I reckon the army’s a little
like me, it couldn’t do its job if it didn’t
get a good laugh now and then—sort o’
clears up the air when things are lookin’
blue. Anyhow the boys are always gettin’
themselves into trouble by their
pranks. Jokin’ fills the guard-house as
often as drunkenness or laziness. That
and their bein’ so sassy. A lot of ’em<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
think they know just as much as the officers
do, and I reckon they’re right pretty
often. It takes some time to learn that
it ain’t good for the service for them to
be speakin’ their minds too free. At the
start they did it pretty often—do now
sometimes. Why, only just this week
Stanton told me about a sergeant, who
one day when the commanding officer
was relieving his mind by swearing at
his men, stepped right out of the ranks
and reproved him and said he was breaking
the law of God. Well, they clapped
him in the guard-house and now they
want to punish him harder—say he ain’t
penitent—keeps disturbin’ the guard-house
by prayin’ at the top of his voice
for that officer. I told Stanton we better
not interfere, that there wasn’t nothing
in the regulations against a man’s prayin’
for his officers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, it’s a funny army. There don’t
seem to be but one thing that discourages
it, and that’s not fightin’. Keep ’em still
in camp where you’d think they’d be comfortable
and they go to pieces every time.
It’s when they’re lyin’ still we have the
worst camp fever and the most deserters.
Keep ’em on the move, let ’em think
they’re goin’ to have a fight and they perk
up right off.</p>

<p>“We can’t fail with men like that.
Make all the mistakes we can, they’ll
make up for ’em. The hope of this war is
in the common soldiers, not in the generals—not
in the War Department, not in me.
It’s in the boys. Sometimes it seems to
me that nobody sees it quite right. It’s in
war as it is in life—a whole raft of men
work day and night and sweat and die to
get in the crops and mine the ore and
build the towns and sail the seas. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
make the wealth but they get mighty little
of it. We ain’t got our values of men’s
work figured out right yet—the value of
the man that gives orders and of the man
that takes ’em. I hear people talkin’ as if
the history of a battle was what the generals
did. I can’t help thinkin’ that the
history of this war is in the knapsack of
the common soldier. He’s makin’ that
history just like the farmers are makin’
the wealth. We fellows at the top are
only usin’ what they make.</p>

<p>“At any rate that’s the way I see it,
and I’ve tried hard ever since I’ve been
down here to do all I could for the boys.
I know lots of officers think I peek
around camp too much, think ’tain’t good
for discipline. But I’ve always felt I
ought to know how they was livin’ and
there didn’t seem to be no other sure way
of findin’ out. Officers ain’t always good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
housekeepers, and I kinda felt I’d got to
keep my eye on the cupboard.</p>

<p>“I reckon Stanton thinks I’ve interfered
too much, but there’s been more’n
enough trouble to go around in this war,
and the only hope was helpin’ where you
could. But ’tain’t much one can do. I
can no more help every soldier that comes
to me in trouble than I can dip all the
water out of the Potomac with a teaspoon.</p>

<p>“Then there’s that pardoning business.
Every now and then I have to fix it up
with Stanton or some officer for pardoning
so many boys. I suppose it’s pretty
hard for them not to have all their rules
lived up to. They’ve worked out a lot of
laws to govern this army, and I s’pose
it’s natural enough for ’em to think the
most important thing in the world is
havin’ ’em obeyed. They’ve got it fixed
so the boys do everything accordin’ to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
regulations. They won’t even let ’em die
of something that ain’t on the list—got
to die accordin’ to the regulations.
But by jingo, Billy, I ain’t goin’ to have
boys shot accordin’ to no dumb regulations!
I ain’t goin’ to have a butcher’s
day every Friday in the army if I can
help it. It’s so what they say about me,
that I’m always lookin’ for an excuse to
pardon somebody. I do it every time I
can find a reason. When they’re young
and when they’re green or when they’ve
been worked on by Copperheads or when
they’ve got disgusted lyin’ still and come
to think we ain’t doin’ our job—when I
see that I ain’t goin’ to have ’em shot.
And then there’s my leg cases. I’ve got a
drawerful. They make Holt maddest—says
he ain’t any use for cowards. Well,
generally speakin’ I ain’t, but I ain’t
sure what I’d do if I was standin’ in front<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
of a gun, and more’n that as I told Holt
if Almighty God gives a man a cowardly
pair of legs how can he help
their running away with him?</p>

<p>“You can’t make me believe it’s good
policy to shoot these soldiers, anyhow.
Seems to me one thing we’ve never taken
into account as we ought to is that this is
a <em>volunteer</em> army. These men came down
here to put an end to this rebellion and
not to get trained as soldiers. They just
dropped the work they was doin’ right
where it was—never stopped to fix up
things to be away long. Why, we’ve got a
little minister at the head of one company
that was preachin’ when he heard the news
of Bull Run. He shut up his Bible, told
the congregation what had happened, and
said: ‘Brethren, I reckon it’s time for us
to adjourn this meetin’ and go home and
drill,’ and they did it, and now they’re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
down with Grant. When the war’s over
that man will go back and finish that
sermon.</p>

<p>“That’s the way with most of ’em.
You can’t treat such an army like you
would one that had been brought up to
soljerin’ as a business. They’ll take discipline
enough to fight, but they don’t
take any stock in it as a means of earnin’
a livin’.</p>

<p>“More’n that they’ve got their own
ideas about politics and military tactics
and mighty clear ideas about all of us that
are runnin’ things. You can’t fool ’em on
an officer. They know when one ain’t fit
to command, and time and time again
they’ve pestered a coward or a braggart
or a bully out of the service. An officer
who does his job best he can, even if he
ain’t very smart, just honest and faithful,
they’ll stand by and help. If he’s a big<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
one, a real big man, they can’t do enough
for him. Take the way they feel about
Thomas, the store they set by him. I
met a boy on crutches out by the White
House the other day and asked him where
he got wounded. He told me about the
place they held. ‘Pretty hot, wasn’t it?’
I said. ‘Yes, but Old Pap put us there
and he wouldn’t ’a’ done it if he hadn’t
known we could ’a’ held it.’ No more
question ‘Old Pap’ than they would God
Almighty. But if it had been some generals
they’d skedaddled.</p>

<p>“They ain’t never made any mistake
about <em>me</em> just because I’m president. A
while after Bull Run I met a boy out on
the street here on crutches, thin and white,
and I stopped to ask him about how he
got hurt. Well, Billy, he looked at me
hard as nails, and he says: ‘Be you Abe
Lincoln?’ And I said, ‘Yes.’ ‘Well,’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
he says, ‘all I’ve got to say is you don’t
know your job. I enlisted glad enough to
do my part and I’ve done it, but you ain’t
done yourn. You promised to feed me,
and I marched three days at the beginning
of these troubles without anything to
eat but hardtack and two chunks of salt
pork—no bread, no coffee—and what I
did get wasn’t regular. They got us up
one mornin’ and marched us ten miles
without breakfast. Do you call that providin’
for an army? And they sent us
down to fight the Rebs at Bull Run, and
when we was doin’ our best and holdin’
’em—I tell you, holdin’ ’em—they told us
to fall back. I swore I wouldn’t—I
hadn’t come down there for that. They
made me—rode me down. I got struck—struck
in the back. Struck in the back
and they left me there—never came for
me, never gave me a drink and I dyin’ of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
thirst. I crawled five miles for water, and
I’d be dead and rottin’ in Virginia to-day
if a teamster hadn’t picked me up and
brought me to this town and found an old
darkey to take care of me. You ain’t
doin’ your job, Abe Lincoln; you won’t
win this war until you learn to take care
of the soldiers.’</p>

<p>“I couldn’t say a thing. It was true.
It’s been true all the time. It’s true to-day.
We ain’t takin’ care of the soldiers
like we ought.</p>

<p>“You don’t suppose such men are goin’
to accept the best lot of regulations ever
made without askin’ questions? Not a
bit of it. They know when things are
right and when they’re not. When they
see a man who they know is nothing but
a boy or one they know’s bein’ eat up with
homesickness or one whose term is out,
and ought to be let go, throwing everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
over and desertin’, it don’t make
them any better soldiers to have us shoot
him. Makes ’em worse in my judgment,
makes ’em think we don’t understand.
Anyhow, discipline or no discipline, I
ain’t goin’ to have any more of it than I
can help. It ain’t good common sense.</p>

<p>“You can’t run <em>this</em> army altogether as
if ’twas a machine. It ain’t. It’s a <em>people’s</em>
army. It offered itself. It has
come down here to fight this thing out—just
as it would go to the polls. It is
greater than its generals, greater than the
administration. We are created to care
for it and lead it. It is not created for
us. Every day the war has lasted I’ve
felt this army growin’ in power and determination.
I’ve felt its hand on me, guiding,
compelling, threatening, upholding
me, felt its distrust and its trust, its blame
and its love. I’ve felt its patience and its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
sympathy. The greatest comfort I get is
when sometimes I feel as if mebbe the
army understood what I was tryin’ to do
whether Greeley did or not. They understood
because it’s <em>their</em> war. Why, we
might fail, every one of us, and this war
would go on. The army would find
its leaders like they say the old Roman
armies sometimes did and would finish
the fight.</p>

<p>“I tell you, Billy, there ain’t nuthin’
that’s ever happened in the world so far
as I know that gives one such faith in the
people as this army and the way it acts.
There’s been times, I ain’t denyin’, when
I didn’t know but the war was goin’ to be
too much for us, times when I thought
that mebbe a republic like this couldn’t
stand such a strain. It’s the kind of government
we’ve got that’s bein’ tested in
this war, government by the people, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
it’s the People’s Army that makes me certain
it can’t be upset.”</p>

<p>I tell you it done me good to see him
settin’ up straight there talkin’ so proud
and confident, and as I was watchin’ him
there popped into my head some words
from a song I’d heard the soldiers sing:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We are coming, Father Abraham, three hundred thousand more—<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Mississippi’s winding stream and from New England’s shore.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">You have called us and we’re coming. By Richmond’s bloody tide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To lay us down, for Freedom’s sake, our brothers’ bones beside;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Six hundred thousand loyal men and true have gone before—<br /></span>

</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>
<p>That was it. That was what he was,
the Father of the Army, Father Abraham,
and somehow the soldiers had found
it out. Curious how a lot of people who
never see a man in their lives will come to
understand him exact.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2 cap">“Yes, sir; he was what I call a
<em>godly</em> man. Fact is, I never
knew anybody I felt so sure
would walk straight into Heaven, everybody
welcomin’ him, nobody fussin’ or
fumin’ about his bein’ let in as Abraham
Lincoln.”</p>

<p>Billy was tilted back in a worn high-back
Windsor, I seated properly in his famous
“Lincoln’s chair,” a seat too revered for
anybody to stand on two legs. It was a
snowy blusterly day and the talk had run
on uninterruptedly from the weather to
the campaign. (The year was 1896, and
Billy, being a gold Democrat, was gloomy
over politics.) We had finally arrived,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
as we always did when we met, at “when
Mr. Lincoln was alive,” and Billy had
been dwelling lovingly on his great
friend’s gentleness, goodness, honesty.</p>

<p>“You know I never knew anybody,” he
went on, “who seemed to me more interested
in God, more curious about Him,
more anxious to find out what He was
drivin’ at in the world, than Mr. Lincoln.
I reckon he was allus that way. There
ain’t any doubt that from the time he was
a little shaver he grabbed on to everything
that came his way—wouldn’t let it go ’til
he had it worked out, fixed in his mind
so he understood it, and could tell it the
way he saw it. Same about religion as
everything else. Of course he didn’t get
no religious teachin’ like youngsters have
nowadays—Sunday schools and church
regular every Sunday—lessons all worked
out, and all kinds of books to explain ’em.
Still I ain’t sure but what they give so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
many helps now, the Bible don’t get much
show.</p>

<p>“It wa’n’t so when Mr. Lincoln was a
boy. No, sir. Bible was the whole thing,
and there ain’t any doubt he knew it pretty
near by heart, knew it well before he ever
could read, for Lincoln had a good mother,
that’s sure, the kind that wanted more
than anything else in the world to have
her boy grow up to be a good man, and
she did all she knew how to teach him
right.</p>

<p>“I remember hearin’ him say once how
she used to tell him Bible stories, teach
him verses—always quotin’ ’em. I can
see him now sprawlin’ on the floor in front
of the fire listenin’ to Nancy Hanks tellin’
him about Moses and Jacob and Noah
and all those old fellows, tellin’ him about
Jesus and his dyin’ on the cross. I tell
you that took hold of a little shaver, livin’
like he did, remote and not havin’ many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
books or places to go. Filled you chuck
full of wonder and mystery, made you lie
awake nights, and sometimes swelled you
all up, wantin’ to be good.</p>

<p>“Must have come mighty hard on him
havin’ her die. Think of a little codger
like him seein’ his mother lyin’ dead in
that shack of theirs, seein’ Tom Lincoln
holdin’ his head and wonderin’ what he’d
do now. Poor little tad! He must have
crept up and looked at her, and gone out
and throwed himself on the ground and
cried himself out. Hard thing for a boy
of nine to lose his mother, specially in
such a place as they lived in.</p>

<p>“I don’t see how he could get much
comfort out of what they taught about
her dyin’, sayin’ it was God’s will, and
hintin’ that if you’d been what you ought
to be it wouldn’t have happened, never
told a man that if he let a woman work
herself to death it was his doin’s she died—not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
God’s will at all—God’s will she
should live and be happy and make him
happy.</p>

<p>“But I must say Mr. Lincoln had luck
in the step-mother he got. If there ever
was a good woman, it was Sarah Johnston,
and she certain did her duty by Tom
Lincoln’s children. ’Twa’n’t so easy either,
poor as he was, the kind that never really
got a hold on anything. Sarah Johnston
did her part—teachin’ Mr. Lincoln just as
his own mother would, and just as anxious
as she’d been to have him grow up a good
man. I tell you she was proud of him
when he got to be President. I remember
seein’ her back in ’62 or ’3 on the farm Mr.
Lincoln gave her, little ways out of
Charleston. One of the last things Mr.
Lincoln did before he went to Washington
was to go down there and see his step-mother.
He knew better than anybody
what she’d done for him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, sir, the best religious teachin’ Mr.
Lincoln ever got was from Tom Lincoln’s
two wives. It was the kind that went
deep and stuck, because he saw ’em livin’
it every day, practicin’ it on him and his
sister and his father and the neighbors.
Whatever else he might have seen and
learnt, when he was a boy he knew what
his two mothers thought religion meant,
and he never got away from that.</p>

<p>“Of course he had other teachin’, principally
what he got from the preachers
that came around, now and then. Ramblin’
lot they was, men all het up over the
sins of the world, and bent on doin’ their
part towards headin’ off people from hell-fire.
They traveled around alone, sometimes
on horseback, sometimes afoot—poor
as Job, not too much to wear or to
eat, never thinkin’ of themselves, only
about savin’ souls; and it was natural that
bein’ alone so much, seein’ so much misery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
and so much wickedness, for there was lots
that was bad in that part of the world in
them times—natural enough meditatin’ as
they did that they preached pretty strong
doctrine. Didn’t have a chance often at
a congregation, and felt they must scare
it to repentance if they couldn’t do no
other way. They’d work up people ’til
they got ’em to shoutin’ for mercy.</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose they ever had anybody
that listened better to ’em than Mr.
Lincoln. I can just see him watchin’ ’em
and tryin’ to understand what they meant.
He was curious, rolled things over, kept
at ’em and no amount of excitement they
stirred up would ever have upset him.
No, he wa’n’t that kind.</p>

<p>“But he remembered what they said,
and the way they said it. Used to get the
youngsters together and try it on them. I
heard him talkin’ in here one day about
the early preachin’ and I remember his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
sayin’: ’I got to be quite a preacher myself
in those days. You know how those
old fellows felt they hadn’t done their duty
if they didn’t get everybody in the church
weepin’ for their sins. We never set
much store by a preacher that didn’t draw
tears and groans. Pretty strong doctrine,
mostly hell-fire. There was a time
when I preached myself to the children
every week we didn’t have a minister.
I didn’t think much of my sermon if I
didn’t make ’em cry. I reckon there was
more oratory than religion in what I had
to say.’</p>

<p>“I reckon he was right about that, allus
tryin’ to see if he could do what other
folks did, sort of measurin’ himself.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, so far as preachin’ was concerned
it was a God of wrath that Abraham
Lincoln was brought up on, and there
ain’t any denyin’ that he had to go through
a lot that carried out that idea. A boy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
can’t grow up in a backwoods settlement
like Gentryville, Indiana, without seein’ a
lot that’s puzzlin’, sort of scares you and
makes you miserable. Things was harsh
and things was skimpy. There wa’n’t
so much to eat. Sometimes there was
fever and ague and rheumatiz and milk
sick. Woman died from too much work.
No medicine—no care, like his mother did.
I expect there wa’n’t any human crime or
sorrow he didn’t know about, didn’t
wonder about. Thing couldn’t be so terrible
he would keep away from it. Why
I heard him tell once how a boy he knew
went crazy, never got over it, used to sing
to himself all night long, and Mr. Lincoln
said that he couldn’t keep away, but used
to slip out nights and listen to that poor
idiot croonin’ to himself. He was like
that, interested in strange things he didn’t
understand, in signs and dreams and
mysteries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>“Still things have to be worse than they
generally are anywhere to keep a boy
down-hearted right along—specially a
boy like Mr. Lincoln, with an investigatin’
turn of mind like his, so many new things
comin’ along to surprise you. Why it
was almost like Robinson Crusoe out there—wild
land, havin’ to make everything
for yourself—hunt your meat and grow
your cotton, mighty excitin’ life for a boy—lots
to do—lots of fun, too, winter and
summer. Somehow when you grow up
in the country you can’t make out that
God ain’t kind, if he is severe. I reckon
that was the way Mr. Lincoln sized it up
early; world might be a vale of tears, like
they taught, but he saw it was mighty interestin’
too, and a good deal of fun to be
got along with the tears.</p>

<p>“Trouble was later to keep things balanced.
The older he grew, the more he
read, and he begun to run up against a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
kind of thinkin’ along about the time he
was twenty-one or twenty-two that was a
good deal different from that he’d been
used to, books that made out the Bible
wa’n’t so, that even said there wa’n’t any
God. We all took a turn at readin’ Tom
Paine and Voltaire out here, and there was
another book—somebody’s ‘Ruins’—I
forget the name.”</p>

<p>“Volney?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s it. Volney’s Ruins.”</p>

<p>“Do you know I think that book took
an awful grip on Mr. Lincoln. I reckon
it was the first time he had ever realized
how long the world’s been runnin’; how
many lots of men have lived and settled
countries and built cities and how time and
time again they’ve all been wiped out.
Mr. Lincoln couldn’t get over that. I’ve
heard him talk about how old the world
was time and time again, how nothing
lasted—men—cities—nations. One set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
on top of another—men comin’ along just
as interested and busy as we are, in doin’
things, and then little by little all they
done passin’ away.</p>

<p>“He was always speculatin’ about that
kind of thing. I remember in ’48 when
he came back from Congress he stopped
to see Niagara Falls. Well, sir, when he
got home he couldn’t talk about anything
else for days, seemed to knock politics
clean out of his mind. He’d sit there that
fall in that chair you’re in and talk
and talk about it. Talk just like it’s
printed in those books his secretary got
up. I never cared myself for all those
articles they wrote. Wrong, am I?
Mebbe so, but there wa’n’t enough of Mr.
Lincoln in ’em to suit me. I wanted to
know what he said about everything in
his own words. But I tell you when I
saw the books with the things he had said
and wrote all brought together nice and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
neat, and one after another, I just took to
that. I’ve got ’em here in my desk, often
read ’em and lots of it sounds just as natural,
almost hear him sayin’ it, just as if
he was settin’ here by the stove.</p>

<p>“Now what he tells about Niagara in the
book is like that—just as if he was here.
I can hear him sayin’: ‘Why, Billy, when
Columbus first landed here, when Christ
suffered on the Cross, when Moses crossed
dry-shod through the Red Sea, even when
Adam was first made, Niagara was roarin’
away. He’d talk in here just as it is
printed there; how the big beasts whose
bones they’ve found in mounds must have
seen the falls, how it’s older than them
and older than the first race of men.
They’re all dead and gone, not even bones
of many of ’em left, and yet there’s
Niagara boomin’ away fresh as ever.</p>

<p>“He used to prove by the way the water
had worn away the rocks that the world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
was at least fourteen thousand years old.
A long spell, but folks tell me it ain’t
nothin’ to what is bein’ estimated now.</p>

<p>“Makes men seem pretty small, don’t
it? God seems to wipe ’em out as careless
like as if He were cleanin’ a slate.
How could He care and do that? It
made such a mite of a man, no better’n
a fly. That’s what bothered Mr. Lincoln.
I know how he felt. That’s the way it
hit me when I first began to understand
all the stars were worlds like ours.
What I couldn’t see and can’t now is how
we can be so blame sure ours is the only
world with men on. And if they’re
others and they’re wiped out regular like
we are, well it knocked me all of a heap at
first, ’peared to me mighty unlikely that
God knew anything about <em>me</em>.</p>

<p>“I expect Mr. Lincoln felt something
like that when he studied how old the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
world was and how one set of ruins was
piled on top of another.</p>

<p>“Then there was another thing. Lots
of those old cities and old nations wa’n’t
Christian at all, and yet accordin’ to the
ruins it looked as if the people was just
as happy, knew just as much, had just
as good laws as any Christian nation now;
some of them a blamed sight better. Now
how was a boy like Lincoln going to
handle a problem like that? Well I
guess for a time he handled it like the man
who wrote about the Ruins. Never
seemed queer to me he should have written
a free-thinkin’ book after that kind
of readin’. I reckon he had to write something
to get his head clear. Allus had
to have things clear.</p>

<p>“You know that story of course about
that book. First time I ever heard it
was back in 1846 when him and Elder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
Cartwright was runnin’ for Congress.
You know about Cartwright? Well, sir,
he made his campaign against Lincoln
in ’46, not on politics at all—made it on
chargin’ him with bein’ an infidel because
he wa’n’t a church member and because
he said Mr. Lincoln had written a free
thought book when he was a boy. He
kept it up until along in the fall Mr.
Lincoln shut him up good. He’d gone
down to where Cartwright lived to make
a political speech and some of us went
along. Cartwright was runnin’ a revival,
and long in the evening before startin’
home we went in and set in the back of
the church. When it came time to ask
sinners to come forward, the elder got
pretty excited. ‘Where be you goin’?’ he
shouted. ‘To Hell if you don’t repent
and come to this altar.’ At last he began
to call on Mr. Lincoln to come forward.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
Well, you know nobody likes to be called
out like that right in meetin’. Mr. Lincoln
didn’t budge, just set there. The
elder he kept it up. Finally he shouted,
‘If Mr. Lincoln ain’t goin’ to repent and
go to Heaven, where is he goin’?’ Intimatin’,
I suppose, that he was headed for
Hell. ‘Where be you goin’, Mr. Lincoln?’
he shouted.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, at that Mr. Lincoln rose up
and said quiet like:</p>

<p>“‘I’m goin’ to Congress.’</p>

<p>“For a minute you could have heard a
pin drop and then—well, I just snorted—couldn’t
help it. Ma was awful
ashamed when I told her, said I oughtin’
to done it—right in meetin’, but I couldn’t
help it—just set there and shook and
shook. The elder didn’t make any more
observations to Mr. Lincoln that trip.</p>

<p>“Goin’ home I said, ‘Mr. Lincoln, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
just served the elder right, shut him up,
and I guess you’re right; you be goin’ to
Congress.’</p>

<p>“‘Well, Billy,’ he said, smilin’ and
lookin’ serious. ‘I’ve made up my mind
that Brother Cartwright ain’t goin’ to
make the religion of Jesus Christ a political
issue in this District if I can help it.’</p>

<p>“Some of the elder’s friends pretended
to think Mr. Lincoln was mockin’ at the
Christian religion when he answered back
like that. Not a bit. He was protectin’
it accordin’ to my way of thinkin’.</p>

<p>“I reckon I understand him a little because
I’m more or less that way myself—can’t
help seein’ things funny. I’ve done
a lot of things Ma says people misunderstand.
A while back comin’ home from
New York I did somethin’ I expect some
people would have called mockin’ at religion;
Mr. Lincoln wouldn’t.</p>

<p>“You see I’d been down to buy drugs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
and comin’ home I was readin’ the Bible
in the mornin’ in my seat in the sleepin’
car. Allus read a chapter every mornin’,
Ma got me in the way of it, and I like it—does
me good—keeps me from burstin’
out at somebody when I get mad, that is,
it does for the most part.</p>

<p>“Well, as I was sayin’, I was readin’
my chapter, and I reckon mebbe I was
readin’ out loud when I looked up and
see the porter lookin’ at me and kinda
snickerin’.</p>

<p>“‘See here, boy,’ I says, ‘you smilin’ at
the Bible. Well, you set down there. Set
down,’ I says. I’m a pretty stout man as
you can see, weigh 200, and I reckon I can
throw most men my size. Why, I’ve
wrestled with Mr. Lincoln, yes, sir, wrestled
with Abraham Lincoln, right out there
in the alley. You see, I ain’t used to bein’
disobeyed, and that nigger knew it, and
he just dropped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘Boy,’ I says, ‘I’m goin’ to read you a
chapter out of this Bible, and you’re goin’
to listen.’ And I did it. ‘Now,’ I says,
‘down with you on your knees, we’re goin’
to have prayers,’ Well, sir, you never
seen such a scared darky. Down he went,
and down I went, and I prayed out loud
for that porter’s soul and before I was
through he was sayin’ ‘Amen.’</p>

<p>“Of course the passengers began to
take notice, and about the time I was done
along came the conductor, and he lit into
me and said he wa’n’t goin’ to have any
such performances in his car.</p>

<p>“Well, you can better guess that gave
me a text. He’d a man in that car fillin’
himself up with liquor half the night, just
plain drunk and disorderly. ‘I ain’t
heard you makin’ any loud objections to
the drinkin’ goin’ on in this car,’ I says.
‘If that don’t disturb the peace, prayin’
won’t.’ And two or three passengers just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
chimed right in and said, ‘That’s so.
Do us all good if we had more prayin’ and
less drinkin’.’ Fact was, I was quite
popular the rest of the trip.</p>

<p>“Now I reckon some would a been
shocked by what I done. Ma said when
I told her. ‘Now you know, William, it
wasn’t that porter’s soul you was interested
in half as much as gettin’ a little fun
out of him.’ Well, mebbe so. I won’t
deny there was some mischief in it. But
it wouldn’t have shocked Mr. Lincoln.
He’d understood. Seems a pity I can’t
tell him about that. He’d enjoyed it.</p>

<p>“Well, to go back to Cartwright and the
free thought book he said Lincoln wrote
when he was a boy. The elder didn’t
pretend he’d seen the book; said the reason
he hadn’t was that it was never printed,
only written, and that not many people
ever did see it because Sam Hill, the storekeeper
down to New Salem, thinkin’ it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
might hurt Lincoln had snatched it away
and thrown it into the stove and burnt it
up. Now what do you think of that?</p>

<p>“Well, Cartwright didn’t get elected—got
beaten—beaten bad and nobody
around here ever talked about that book
when Mr. Lincoln was runnin’ for President
that I heard of. It was after he
was dead that somebody raked up that
story again and printed it. It never made
much difference to me. I allus thought
it likely he did write something along
the lines he’d been readin’ after. But
sakes alive, you ought to seen the fur fly
out here. All the church people riz right
up and proved it wa’n’t so; and those that
didn’t profess lit in and proved it was so.
They got all the old inhabitants of Sangamon
County who knew Mr. Lincoln to
writin’ letters. Lot of them published
in the papers.</p>

<p>“One of the most interestin’ accordin’ to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
my way of thinkin’ was a letter that came
out from Mentor Graham, Lincoln’s old
school-master. I don’t remember it exact,
but near as I can recall he said Lincoln
asked him one day when he was livin’
at his house going to school what he
thought about the anger of the Lord, and
then he went on to say that he had written
something along that line and wished
Mr. Graham would read it. Well, sir,
Mr. Graham wrote in that letter that this
thing Lincoln wrote proved God was too
good to destroy the people He’d made, and
that all the misery Adam brought on us
by his sin had been wiped out by the atonement
of Christ. Now mind that was an
honest man writin’ that letter, a man
who’d been Lincoln’s friend from the
start. To be sure it was some time after
the event—pretty near 40 years and I
must say I always suspicion a man’s remembering
anything very exact after 40<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
years. But one thing is sure, Mentor
Graham knew Lincoln in those days, and
that’s more than most of them that was
arguin’ this thing did.</p>

<p>“Always seemed to me about as reliable
testimony as anybody offered. I contended
that most likely Lincoln did write
just what Mentor Graham said he did, and
that the brethren thought it was dangerous
doctrine to make out God was that good,
and so they called him an infidel. Nothin’
riled those old fellows religiously like tryin’
to make out God didn’t damn everybody
that didn’t believe according to the
way they read the Scriptures. Seemed
to hate to think about Mr. Lincoln’s God.
I almost felt sometimes as if they’d rather
a man would say there wa’n’t no God than
to make him out a God of Mercy.</p>

<p>“But sakes’ alive, Mentor Graham’s
letter didn’t settle it. The boys used to
get to rowin’ about it in here sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
around the stove until I could hardly
keep track of my perscriptions. The
funniest thing you ever heard was one
night when they were at it and an old
fellow who used to live in New Salem
dropped in, so they put it up to him; said
he lived in New Salem in ’33; said he
knew Lincoln. Wanted to know if he
ever heard of his writin’ a book that Sam
Hill burned up in the stove in his store.
The old fellow listened all through without
sayin’ a word, and when they was finished
he said, solemn like, ‘Couldn’t have
happened. Wa’n’t no stove. Sam Hill
never had one.’</p>

<p>“Well, sir, you ought to seen their
jaws drop. Just set starin’ at him and I
thought I’d die a laffin’ to see ’em collapse.
I wish Mr. Lincoln could have heard that
old fellow, ‘Wa’n’t no stove.’ How he’d
enjoyed that—‘Wa’n’t no stove.’</p>

<p>“But for all that I never regarded that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
witness over high. Of course Sam Hill
must have had a stove otherwise there
wouldn’t have been a place for folks to
set around.</p>

<p>“It ain’t important to my mind what
was in that book. What’s important is
that Abraham Lincoln was wrestlin’ in
those days to find out the truth, wa’n’t
content like I was to settle down smotherin’
any reservations that I might a had.
He never did that, grappled hard with
everything touchin’ religion that came up,
no matter which side it was. He never
shirked the church if he wa’n’t a member,
went regular, used to go to revivals and
camp meetings too in those days when he
was readin’ the ‘Ruins.’ Most of the
boys who didn’t profess went to camp
meetings for deviltry—hang around on
the edges—playin’ tricks—teasin’ the
girls—sometimes gettin’ into regular
fights. Mr. Lincoln never joined into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
any horse play like that. He took it
solemn. I reckon he wouldn’t ever hesitated
a minute to go forward and ask
prayers if he’d really believed that was
the way for him to find God. He knew
it wa’n’t. The God he was searchin’ for
wa’n’t the kind they was preachin’. He
was tryin’ to find one that he could reconcile
with what he was findin’ out about
the world—its ruins—its misery. Clear
as day to me that that was what he was
after from the start—some kind of plan
in things, that he could agree to.</p>

<p>“He certainly did have a lot to discourage
him—worst was when he lost his
sweetheart. I’ve allus figured it out that
if Ann Rutledge had lived and married
him he’d been a different man—leastwise
he’d been happier. He might have even
got converted and joined the church, like
I did after I courted Ma. A good woman
sort of carries a man along when he loves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
her. It’s a mighty sight easier to believe
in the goodness of the Lord and the happiness
of man when you’re in love like
I’ve allus been, and like he was with that
girl.</p>

<p>“‘There was no doubt she was a fine girl—no
doubt he loved her. When she died
he was all broke up for days. I’ve heard
his old friends tell how he give up workin’
and readin’—wandered off into the fields
talkin’ to himself. Seemed as if he
couldn’t bear to think of her covered over
with snow—beaten on by rain—wastin’
away—eaten by worms. I tell you he
was the kind that saw it all as it was.
That’s the hard part of bein’ so honest
you see things just as they are—don’t pretend
things are different—just as they
are. He couldn’t get over it. I believe
it’s the Lord’s mercy he didn’t kill himself
those days. Everybody thought he was
goin’ crazy, but I rather think myself he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
was wrestlin’ with himself, tryin’ to make
himself live. Men like him want to die
pretty often. I reckon he must have
cried out many a night like Job did,
‘What is mine end that I should prolong
my life? My soul chooseth strangling
and death rather than life. I loathe it.
I would not live alway.’</p>

<p>“He pulled out, of course, but he never
got over havin’ spells of terrible gloom.
I expect there was always a good many
nights up to the end when he wondered if
life was worth keepin’. Black moods
took him and he’d go days not hardly
speakin’ to people—come in here—set by
the stove—not sayin’ a word—get up—go
out—hardly noticin’ you. Boys understood,
used to say ‘Mr. Lincoln’s got
the blues.’</p>

<p>“Curious how quick things changed
with him. He’d be settin’ here, laffin’
and jokin’, tellin’ stories and somebody’d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
drop some little thing, nobody else would
think about, and suddent his eyes would
go sad and his face broodin’ and he’d stop
talkin’ or like as not get up and go out.
I don’t mean to say this happened often.
Of course that wa’n’t so; as I’ve told you
no end of times, he was the best company
that ever was—the fullest of stories and
jokes, and nobody could talk serious like
him. You could listen forever when he’d
get to arguin’, but spite of all that you
knew somehow he was a lonely man who
had to fight hard to keep up his feelin’
that life was worth goin’ on with. Gave
you queer feelin’ about him—you knew
he was different from the others, and it
kept you from bein’ over-familiar.</p>

<p>“There was a man in here the other day
I hadn’t seen for years—used to be a conductor
between here and Chicago—knew
him well. It tickled him to death to have
me set him in that chair you’re in—looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
it all over, said it seemed as if he could
just see Mr. Lincoln settin’ there. Well,
he got to talkin’ about all the big bugs
that used to travel with him, Little Dug,
Judge Davis, Logan, Swett, Welden,
and all the rest; and he said something
about Mr. Lincoln that shows how he
struck ordinary people. He said Lincoln
was the most folksy of any of them, but
that there was something about him that
made everybody stand a little in awe of
him. You could get near him in a sort
of neighborly way, as though you had always
known him, but there was something
tremendous between you and him all the
time.</p>

<p>“This man said he had eaten with him
many times at the railroad eatin’ houses.
Everybody tried to get near Lincoln
when he was eatin’, because he was such
good company, but they looked at him
with a kind of wonder, couldn’t exactly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
make him out. Sometimes there was a
dreadful loneliness in his look, and the
boys used to wonder what he was thinkin’
about. Whatever it was, he was thinkin’
all alone. No one was afraid of him,
but there was something about him that
made plain folks feel toward him a good
deal as a child feels toward his father,
because you know every child looks upon
his father as a wonderful man.</p>

<p>“There ain’t any doubt but there was
a good many years after Mr. Lincoln got
started and everybody in the state held
him high, when he was a disappointed man
and when he brooded a good deal over the
way life was goin’. Trouble was he
hadn’t got a grip yet on anything that
satisfied him. He hadn’t made a go of
politics, had quit it. Of course he had
plenty of law practice, but, Lord a
mighty, you take a town like this was
along in the ’40’s and ’50’s, when Mr. Lincoln<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
was practicin’ here, and get right
down to what was really happenin’, and it
was enuff to make a broodin’ man like him
sick, and want to quit. He had to handle
it all, a lawyer does, men fightin’ over a
dollar, gettin’ rich on cheatin’, stingy with
their wives, breakin’ up families, quarrelin’
over wills, neglectin’ the old folks
and yet standin’ high in the church, regular
at prayer meetin’, and teachin’ in Sunday
School. There was a lot of steady
meanness like that all around, and it made
him feel bad.</p>

<p>“And then there was dreadful things
happened every now and then, men takin’
up with girls when they had good wives
of their own. There’s more than one
poor child lyin’ over there in the graveyard
because some onery old scoundrel
got the better of her, and there’s more
than one good man been put to shame in
this town because some woman who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
no better than she ought to be run him
down. Lord, it makes you sick, and then
every now and then right out of a clear
sky there’d be a murder somewhere in the
country. Nobody would talk of anything
else for days. People who hardly
ever opened their mouths would find their
tongues and tell the durnedest things.</p>

<p>“It was so all the time Mr. Lincoln
was practicin’ out here. And it made
him pretty miserable sometimes, I reckon,
to see so much meanness around. I
never knew a man who liked people better’n
Mr. Lincoln did—seemed as if he
felt the world ought to be happy, and
that it could be if people would only do
the right thing. You’ve heard people
tellin’ how he’d refuse a case often if he
didn’t think it ought to be brought.
Well, sir, that’s true. I’ve heard him
argue time and again with the boys about
the duty of lawyers to discourage lawsuits.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
‘It’s our business to be peacemakers,’
he used to tell ’em, ‘not to stir up
quarrels for the sake of makin’ a little
money.’ I remember somebody tellin’
how they heard him lecturin’ a man who’d
brought him a case, and pointed out that
by some sort of a legal trick, he could get
$600. Made Lincoln mad all through.
‘I won’t take your case,’ he said, ‘but I’ll
give you some free advice. You’re a
husky young man. Go to work and <em>earn</em>
your $600.’</p>

<p>“I’ve always figured it out that he was
a sight more contented after he got his
grip on the slavery question. You know
how he felt about slavery; thought it was
wrong, and when he began to see there
was a chance to fight it in a way that
would count, he felt different towards his
life, saw it did mean something, began to
feel he was some real use. I reckon he
began to believe God had a place for him—that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
he was put into the world for a
good and sufficient reason. Now as I
see Mr. Lincoln, that was all he ever
needed to reconcile him to things. As he
began to see more and more that he had
his argument sound, and that it was
takin’ hold in the country, that men was
listenin’ to him and sayin’ he had it right,
why more and more he was something like
happy. He made up his mind that the
time had come when God meant to say to
slavery, ‘Thus far and no farther,’ and he
was ready to put in his best licks to help
Him.</p>

<p>“He wrestled with that question till he
drove it clean out of politics right down
onto bed rock of right and wrong, and
there he stood; slavery was wrong, and
accordin’ to his way of lookin’ at it, people
who pretended to regulate their lives
on religion ought to be agin it. Allus
troubled him a lot and sometimes made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
him pretty bitter that so many folks that
stood high as Christians was for slavery.
I remember Newt Bateman tellin’ how
Lincoln came in his office one day after
his nomination—Newt was State School
Superintendent, and he and Mr. Lincoln
was always great friends,—well, he said
Mr. Lincoln came in with a report of a
canvass of how people in Springfield were
goin’ to vote, and he said:</p>

<p>“‘Let’s see how the ministers in this
town are goin’ to vote,’ and he went
through the list pickin’ ’em out and settin’
’em down, and, would you believe it
now, he found that out of 23 ministers 20
were against him. He was dreadfully
upset, and talked a long time about it.
Newt said he pulled a New Testament
out of his pocket.</p>

<p>“‘What I don’t understand,’ he said,
‘is how anybody can think this book stands
for slavery. Human bondage can’t live<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
a minute in its light, and yet here’s all
these men who consider themselves called
to make the teachin’ of this book clear
votin’ against me. I don’t understand
it.</p>

<p>“‘They know Douglas don’t care
whether slavery’s voted up or down, but
they ought to know that God cares and
humanity cares and they know I care.
They ain’t been readin’ their Bibles right.</p>

<p>“‘Seems to me sometimes as if God had
borne with this thing until the very teachers
of religion had come to defend it out
of the Bible. But they’ll find the day
will come when His wrath will upset it.
I believe the cup of iniquity is full, and
that before we get through God will make
the country suffer for toleratin’ a thing
that is so contrary to what He teaches in
this Book.’</p>

<p>“As I see it, that idee grew in him.
You know how he hated war. Seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
as if he couldn’t stand it sometimes, but
there ain’t no doubt that more and more
he looked at it as God’s doin’—His way
of punishin’ men for their sin in allowin’
slavery. He said that more’n once to the
country. Remember what he wrote in
his call for a fast-day in the spring of
’63? No? Well, I’ve got it here—just
let me read it to you.”</p>

<p>Billy rose, and after lingering long
enough at the window to remark that the
“storm wa’n’t lettin’ up any,” went to a
scratched and worn desk, a companion
piece to “Mr. Lincoln’s chair,” and took
from the drawer where he kept his precious
relics a bundle of faded yellow newspapers
and selected a copy of the New
York <cite>Tribune</cite> of March 31, 1863.</p>

<p>“Now you listen,” said Billy, “and see
if I ain’t right that his idee when he talked
to Newt had takin’ hold of him deep.”
So Billy read sonorously the sentences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
which seemed to him to demonstrate his
point:</p>

<p>“‘Insomuch as we know that by His divine
law nations, like individuals, are subjected
to punishments and chastisements
in this world, may we not justly fear that
the awful calamity of civil war which now
desolates the land may be but a punishment
inflicted upon us for our presumptuous
sins, to the needful end of our national
reformation as a whole people.’</p>

<p>“Isn’t that just what he said to Newt
Bateman,” Billy stopped long enough to
remark.</p>

<p>“‘We have been the recipients of the
choicest bounties of Heaven. We have
been preserved, these many years, in
peace and prosperity. We have grown
in numbers, wealth, and power as no other
nation has ever grown; but we have forgotten
God. We have forgotten the
gracious hand which preserved us in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
peace, and multiplied and enriched and
strengthened us; and we have vainly imagined,
in the deceitfulness of our hearts,
that all these blessings were produced by
some superior wisdom and virtue of our
own. Intoxicated with unbroken success,
we have become too self-sufficient to
feel the necessity of redeeming and preserving
grace, too proud to pray to the
God that made us.</p>

<p>“‘It behooves us, then, to humble ourselves
before the offended Power, to confess
our national sins, and to pray for
clemency and forgiveness.’</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“The longer the war went on, the more
and more sure he was that God was
workin’ out something, and hard as it was
for him, the more and more reconciled he
got to God’s Government. Seems to me
that’s clear from what he said in his last
Inaugural. You remember:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>“The Almighty has His own purposes.
‘Woe unto the world because of offenses!
For it must needs be that offenses come;
but woe to that man by whom the offense
cometh.’ Fondly do we hope, fervently
do we pray that this mighty scourge of
war may speedily pass away, yet if God
wills that it continue until all the wealth
piled by the bondsman’s two hundred and
fifty years of unrequited toil shall be
sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn
with the lash shall be paid by another
drawn with the sword, as was said three
thousand years ago, so still it must be
said, ‘The judgments of the Lord are
true and righteous altogether.’</p>

<p>“I like to say that just like he said it.
Seems kinda like music. He was that
way sometimes, swung into sort of talk
and made your heart stop to listen; it was
so sweet and solemn-like.</p>

<p>“Makes me ache though to think what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
he had to go through to come out where
he could talk so sure and calm about
things; for certain as he was that God
had a purpose in it all, he wa’n’t so sure
always that he was proceedin’ along the
lines the Almighty approved of. He
never got over that struggle long as he
was President, always askin’ himself
whether he was on God’s side. Puzzled
him bad that both sides thought God was
with ’em. He pointed out more than
once how the rebel soldiers was prayin’
for victory just as earnest as ours—how
the rebel people got the same kind of help
out of prayer that the Union people did.
And both couldn’t be right.</p>

<p>“There isn’t any doubt he often tested
out whether God agreed with his argument
or not, by the way things swung.
It was that way about the Emancipation
Proclamation. You know how he
thought about that for months, and for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
the most part kept it to himself. He
didn’t want to do it that way, was dead
set on the North buying the slaves instead
of takin’ ’em. But he had the
Emancipation Proclamation ready, and
he’d told God he’d let it loose if He’d
give us the victory. Sounds queer,
mebbe, but that’s what he did. He told
the Cabinet so, and they’ve told about it.
A little mite superstitious, some would
say. But Mr. Lincoln was a little superstitious,
interested in things like signs and
dreams—specially dreams, seemed to feel
they might be tryin’ to give him a hint.
He’s told me many a time about dreams
he’d had, used to have same dream over
and over, never got tired studyin’ what it
meant. You remember that happened in
the war. He’d used to dream he saw a
curious lookin’ boat runnin’ full speed toward
a shore he couldn’t make out clear,
had that dream before nearly all the big<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
battles—had it the night before they
killed him, and told the Cabinet about it—thought
it meant there’d be good news
from Sherman.</p>

<p>“He got powerful discouraged sometimes,
for it did seem the first three years
of the war as if the Almighty wa’n’t sympathizin’
over much with the North.
You remember how I told you once of
havin’ a long talk with him at night that
time I went down to Washington to see
him. Things was bad, awful bad. Country
just plumb worn out with the war.
People was beginnin’ to turn against it.
Couldn’t stand the blood lettin’, the sufferin’,
and the awful wickedness of it.
There was a lot of that feelin’ in ’64.
People willin’ to give up anything—let
the South go—let her keep her slaves—do
anything to put an end to the killin’.
I tell you a man has to keep his eyes ahead
in war—keep tellin’ himself over and over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
what’s it all about. Mr. Lincoln had to.
They were talkin’ peace to him, riotin’
about the drafts, stirrin’ up more kinds of
trouble for him than he ever knew there
was, I reckon. And he felt it—felt it
bad; and that night it seemed to do him
good to talk it out. You see I come from
home, and I didn’t have no connection
with things down there, and ’twas natural
he’d open up to me as he couldn’t to them
on the ground; and he did.</p>

<p>“‘I’ve studied a lot, Billy,’ he said,
‘whether this is God’s side of this war.
I’ve tried my best to figure it out straight,
and I can’t see anything but that He must
be for us. But look how things is goin’.</p>

<p>“‘One thing sure all I can do is to follow
what I think’s right. Whatever shall
appear to be God’s will, I’ll do. There’s
quite a number of people who seem to
think they know what God wants me to
do. They come down every now and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
then and tell me so. I must say as I’ve
told some of them that it’s more’n likely
if God is goin’ to reveal His will on a
point connected with my duty He’d naturally
reveal it to me. They don’t all lay
it up against me when I talk that way.
Take the Quakers. They’re good people,
and they’ve been in a bad fix for they
don’t believe in slavery, and they don’t
believe in war, and yet it seems to have
come to the point that out of this war
started to save free government, we’re going
to get rid of slavery. But they can’t
accept that way. Still they don’t lay it
up against me that I do, and they pray
regular for me.</p>

<p>“‘We’ve been wrong, North and South,
about slavery. No use to blame it all on
the South. We’ve been in it too, from
the start. If both sides had been willin’
to give in a little, we might a worked it
out, that is if we’d all been willin’ to admit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
the thing was wrong, and take our share
of the burden in puttin’ an end to it. It’s
because we wouldn’t or mebbe couldn’t
that war has come.</p>

<p>“‘It’s for our sins, Billy, this war is.
We’ve brought it on ourselves. And
God ain’t goin’ to stop it because we ask
Him to. We’ve got to fulfill the law.
We broke the law, and God wouldn’t be
God as I see Him if He didn’t stand by
His own laws and make us take all that’s
comin’ to us. I can’t think we won’t win
the war. Seems to me that must be God’s
way, but if we don’t, and the Union is
broken and slavery goes on, well, all it
means accordin’ to my way of seein’
things is that the laws ain’t satisfied yet,
that we ain’t done our part. There’ll
be more trouble until the reason of trouble
ends.</p>

<p>“‘But I don’t lay it up against God,
Billy. What it seems to me He’s tryin’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
to do is to get men to see that there can’t
be any peace or happiness in this world
so long as they ain’t fair to one another.
You can’t have a happy world unless
you’ve got a just world, and slavery ain’t
just. It’s got to go. I don’t know
when. It’s always seemed to me a pretty
durable struggle—did back in ’58, but I
didn’t see anything so bad then as we’ve
come to. Even if I’d known I couldn’t
have done different, Billy. Even if we
don’t win this war and the Confederates
set up a country with slavery in it, that
ain’t going to end it for me. I’ll have to
go on fightin’ slavery. I know God
means I should.</p>

<p>“‘It takes God a long time to work out
His will with men like us, Billy, bad men,
stupid men, selfish men. But even if
we’re beat, there’s a gain. There are
more men who see clear now how hard it
is for people to rule themselves, more people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
determined government by the people
shan’t perish from the earth, more people
willin’ to admit that you can’t have
peace when you’ve got a thing like slavery
goin’ on. That’s something, that’s goin’
to help when the next struggle comes.</p>

<p>“‘You mustn’t think I’m givin’ in,
Billy. I ain’t, but look how things are
goin’. What if we lose the election, and
you must admit it looks now as if we
would, what if we lose and a Copperhead
Government makes peace—gives the
South her slaves—lets the “erring sisters”
set up for themselves. I’ve got to think
about that, Billy.</p>

<p>“‘Seems to me I can’t bear the idea all
this blood-lettin’ should end that way, for
I know lasting peace ain’t in that set of
circumstances. That means trouble,
more trouble, mebbe war again until we
obey the law of God, and let our brother
man go free.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>“And he just dropped his head and
groaned, seemed as if I could hear him
prayin’, ‘Oh, my Father, if it be possible,
let this cup pass from me!’</p>

<p>“Think he prayed? Think Abraham
Lincoln prayed?” Billy’s eyes were
stern, and his voice full of reproachful
surprise.</p>

<p>“I <em>know</em> he did. You wouldn’t ask
that question if you could have heard him
that night he left here for Washington
sayin’ good-by to us in the rain, tellin’ us
that without God’s help he could not succeed
in what he was goin’ into—that with
it, he could not fail; tellin’ us he was turnin’
us over to God, and askin’ us to remember
him in our prayers. Why, a man
can’t talk like that that don’t pray, leastwise
an honest man like Abraham Lincoln.</p>

<p>“And he couldn’t have stood it without
God, sufferin’ as he did, abused as he was,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
defeated again and again, and yet always
hangin’ on, always believin’. Don’t you
<em>see</em> from what I’ve been tellin’ you that
Abraham Lincoln all through the war
was seekin’ to work with God, strugglin’
to find out His purpose, and make it prevail
on earth. A man can’t do that unless
he gets close to God, talks with Him.</p>

<p>“How do you suppose a man—just a
common man, like Abraham Lincoln, could
ever have risen up to say anything like
he did in ’65 in his Inaugural if he hadn’t
known God:</p>

<p>“‘With malice toward none, with charity
for all; with firmness in the right, as
God gives us to see the right, let us strive
on to finish the work we are in; to bind
up the nation’s wounds; to care for him
who shall have borne the battle and for
his widow and his orphan—to do which
may achieve a just and lasting peace
among ourselves and with all nations.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>“That ain’t ordinary human nature—particularly
when it’s fightin’ a war—that’s
God’s nature. If that ain’t what
Christ had in mind, then I don’t read the
Bible right.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, he <em>prayed</em>—that’s what carried
him on—and, God heard him and
helped him. Fact is I never knew a
man I felt so sure God approved of as
Abraham Lincoln.”</p>
